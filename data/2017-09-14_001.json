If you're classed as an employee and started your job on or after 6 April 2012 - the qualifying period is normally 2 years. It should be dropped to 12 months to give people a bit more security in work and to stop employers getting rid of employees under ridiculous excuses and giving the employees a leg to stand on!","state":"open","signature_count":14,"created_at":"2017-09-12T12:09:33.099Z","updated_at":"2017-09-13T23:29:07.230Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-09-13T16:03:35.945Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-09-12T12:36:06.353Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"James Martin","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}}]}
