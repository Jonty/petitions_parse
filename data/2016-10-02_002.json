The latter provides for public service pensions to be uprated at the same time and by the same percentage as the increase in the additional pension provided under the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (SERPS), which has been based on the increase in the CPI since April 2011. Prior to this date the RPI was used rather than the CPI. The underlying purpose of this legislation is to maintain the purchasing power of the additional elements of state retirement pensions and public service pensions. \r\n\r\nThe rationale for the change is as follows:\r\n•\tCPI is the headline measure of inflation used by the Bank of England;\r\n•\tCPI takes better account of how behaviour changes in response to price changes; \r\n•\tCPI also more accurately represents the inflation experience of pensioners and benefit recipients – for example, RPI excludes pensioners who receive a significant proportion of their income from the State (up to 20% of retired households); and\r\n•\tCPI is less volatile – for example, RPI was negative in September 2009 whereas CPI continued to rise.\r\n\r\nThe pension is accrued (or activated) on the basis of current prices.  The uprating of pensions does not apply retrospectively.\r\n\r\nIn response to a legal challenge against this decision the High Court and the Court of Appeal both ruled in the Government's favour, finding that CPI is appropriate for benefits and pensions uprating.\r\n\r\nRPI has also historically experienced periods of negative year on year change, as in 2009 when the uprating of pensions in payment was also frozen.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence","created_at":"2016-05-27T14:26:17.605Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T14:28:05.184Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":128795,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/128795.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Amend the immigration bill to allow 3000 lone child refugees to enter the UK","background":"On Monday 25th April 2016, MPs voted AGAINST amending the bill to allow these stranded children refuge in the UK.

We are looking to transfer children who were already registered in Europe before the EU-Turkey deal came into force on 20 March, where it is in their best interests.\r\n\r\nWe must put the best interests of children first, and avoid any policy that places children at additional risk or encourages them to place their lives in the hands of the people traffickers and criminal gangs.  In any response, we need to be very careful not to inadvertently create a situation in which families see an advantage in sending children ahead, putting their lives at risk by attempting perilous sea crossings to Europe.\r\n\r\nWe will work closely with local authorities. We must ensure we fulfil our obligations to children who are already in UK, as well ensuring we have the right support for those who may be brought to the UK from Europe.\r\n\r\nWe will consult relevant NGOs, UNHCR, UNICEF and Member States on how best we implement this legislation.  The very nature of this amendment means we must take the time to consult others before bringing final proposals on how to implement.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, the UK continues to take a comprehensive approach to the Syria conflict and migration crisis by providing significant aid and assistance; including our resettlement programmes.  On 4 February 2016, the Prime Minister announced that the UK will more than double our total pledge to the Syria crisis from £1.12 billion to over £2.3 billion.  This is our largest ever response to a single humanitarian crisis.  The Syrian Resettlement Scheme has already provided safe haven to more than 1000 vulnerable Syrians – around half of them children - and overall we expect children to make up a significant proportion of the 20,000 resettlement places we are providing to this group.\r\n\r\nAs announced on 21 April, we have worked closely with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to design a resettlement scheme that will protect the most vulnerable children. The new scheme has been designed with the UNHCR to resettle ‘children at risk’ from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.  The Government has committed to resettling several hundred individuals in the first year with a view to resettling up to 3000 individuals over the lifetime of this Parliament, the majority of which will be children, where the UNHCR deem it to be in their best interests. Children who are identified as at risk will be resettled with their family members or carers where appropriate.  There will be a review of the scheme at the two year mark.\r\n\r\nThis unique initiative will be the largest resettlement effort that focuses on children at risk from the MENA region.  The new scheme will be in addition to the Prime Minister’s commitment to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees. It is also in addition to our other existing resettlement schemes. \r\n\r\nIn regards to Europe, we are providing significant assistance to Member States facing particular pressures to ensure that all refugees can have effective access to protection, wherever they are.   The UK is the largest bilateral contributor to the humanitarian response to the crisis in Europe and the Balkans with a total contribution of £65m.  This includes nearly £46 million to provide life-saving aid to migrants and refugees including food, water, hygiene kits and infant packs, and protection for the most vulnerable, as well as support to organisations helping governments build their capacity to manage arrivals in Greece and the Balkans. The efforts of the partners we fund are targeted to reach the most vulnerable - including children.\r\n\r\nIt also includes the £10m Refugee Children Fund the Department for International Development (DFID) has created to support the needs of vulnerable refugee and migrant children specifically in Europe. The fund will support three specialist and mandated organisations UNHCR, Save the Children and the International Rescue Committee to work with host authorities to care for and assist unaccompanied or separated children in Europe and the Balkans. \r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2016-05-12T15:41:46.490Z","updated_at":"2016-05-12T15:41:46.490Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":128510,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/128510.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Save West Cumberland Hospital","background":"West Cumberland Hospital serves the West of the county of Cumbria.

Cannabis has the capacity to damage people’s mental and physical health, and harms both individuals and communities. ","details":"The evidence from the Government’s independent experts, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, is that the use of cannabis is a “significant public health issue and can unquestionably cause harm to individuals and society”.  Legalising it would not prevent the crime associated with its production and supply, nor prevent the associated harms to users, their families and wider society. \r\n\r\nLegalisation would wrongly signal that cannabis use is without risk, particularly among those who do not use drugs. It is vital that we prevent people, especially young people, from using drugs in the first place and intervene early with those who do start to develop problems. Making cannabis legal would be counter-productive to this action.\r\n\r\nIndeed legalisation would carry its own administrative and enforcement costs which could be substantial. A system of this kind would continue to require resources from health services, enforcement partners and the criminal justice system to manage wider prescription and dependence treatment costs – including treating health harms of individual users; compliance activity and monitoring activities around production, demand and supply.\r\n\r\nWhere claims are made for medicinal applications, there is a clear regime in place, administered by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The regime enables medicines (including those containing controlled drugs) to be developed, licensed and made available for medicinal use to patients in the UK. For example, the cannabis-based medicine ‘Sativex’ has been granted marketing authorisation in the UK by the MHRA for the treatment of spasticity due to multiple sclerosis. Sativex was rigorously tested for its safety and efficacy before receiving approval. \r\n\r\nThe MHRA is open to considering marketing approval applications for other medicinal cannabis products should a product be developed. As happened in the case of Sativex in 2010, the Home Office will consider issuing a licence to enable trials of any new medicine providing it complies with appropriate ethical approvals.\r\n\r\nThe Government continues to take action to prevent the harms caused by drug use – from educating young people about the risks to helping dependent individuals through treatment, and supporting law enforcement in tackling the illicit trade.  We have seen a reduction in drug misuse among adults and young people compared with a decade ago and more people are recovering from their dependency now than in 2009/10. \r\n\r\nThe Government is currently developing a new Drug Strategy, working with key partners, including commissioners, treatment providers, service users and our independent experts, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, to identify what further steps we can take to tackle the issue.  \r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2016-08-23T10:56:47.985Z","updated_at":"2016-08-23T10:56:47.985Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":163428,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/163428.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Prevent the closure of the Maternity Unit at Banbury Horton General Hospital","background":"Banbury is one of the largest towns in Oxfordshire and getting bigger.\r\nThe services of the Maternity ward at Horton Banbury save and support babies, mums and families and has done so in the past. \r\nHaving to go to the JR in Oxford is risking way too many lives.

The Government published the national mental health strategy, No Health Without Mental Health in 2011, which set out our priorities for improving access to mental health services for people of all ages. We also enshrined in legislation through the Health and Social Care Act 2012, the commitment to put mental health on an equal footing as physical health. \r\n\r\nWe are spending more on mental health provision than ever before with annual spending estimated to have increased to £11.7 billion. Local clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) are responsible for commissioning mental health services for their local populations and ensuring they are accessible to those who need them. CCGs are required to continue increasing their spending on mental health each year in line with the growth in their overall funding allocations to provide health services. As well as this, the Government has implemented the first waiting times for mental health starting with psychological therapies and early intervention in psychosis services to improve access to these services. We have also committed to expanding access to psychological services so that an extra 600,000 people will have access to treatment by 2020.\r\n\r\nWe welcomed the publication of the independent Mental Health Taskforce’s Five Year Forward View for Mental Health earlier this year. This ambitious vision to transform mental health services by 2020 made a wide range of recommendations across Government and the NHS and we are working with our partners to embed its recommendations in our national policies.  The Government announced an additional £1 billion by 2020 to support implementation of the Five Year Forward View for Mental Health which included £400 million to improve community mental health services, £290 million to improve perinatal mental health and £250 million to improve the provision of liaison mental health services in hospitals. The suicide rate in England has been increasing since 2007 and suicide is now the biggest killer of men under 50 as well as being a leading cause of death in young people. We published the cross-Government National Suicide Prevention Strategy in 2012, support by £1.5 million for new research to address this issue. The delivery of the strategy is led by the National Suicide Prevention Strategy Advisory Group.  \r\n\r\nThe National Suicide Prevention Strategy identified men as a high risk group for which suicide prevention interventions should be prioritised and identified young people as a group which requires a tailored approach to meet their specific needs. The Department of Health publishes annual progress reports on implementing the strategy.\r\n\r\nTo implement the strategy, the Department of Health works in partnership with other Government Departments as well as other partners such as the Samaritans and provide financial support for the National Suicide Prevention Alliance, which comprises suicide prevention charities and organisations. The National Suicide Prevention Alliance has published a Strategic Framework to support delivery of the national strategy which includes specific work on targeting men and improving help-seeking for men.\r\n\r\nWe have accepted the recommendations of the Five Year Forward View for Mental Health to reduce the national suicide rate by 10 percent by 2020/21 and for every local area to implement local multi-agency suicide prevention plans by 2017. We are also looking at ways in which we can strengthen delivery of the National Strategy and will publish further details later this year. We know that for men the stigma associated with mental health can create a significant barrier for them talking about mental health issues and seeking help. The Department of Health continues to provide financial support to the national Time to Change Programme which seeks to bring about attitudinal change in people towards mental health issues.  To date over 3.5 million people have reported improved attitudes to mental health. Time to Change works with local communities to bring about changes in attitudes at the grass roots and this includes working with children and young people to enable them to become mental health champions.\r\n\r\nPublic Health England is responsible for improving mental health and wellbeing of the general population which it does by working with regional Directors of Public Health, the NHS and local authorities. In line with the recommendation of the Five Year Forward View for Mental Health, Public Health England is developing a National Mental Health Prevention Concordat to work across Government and wide range of statutory and no-statutory sectors to improve mental wellbeing.

","details":"The Government is committed to providing secure, affordable and clean energy, now and for the future. We need to replace our ageing infrastructure with low-carbon, reliable energy sources; and aim to do so through a mix of technologies and energy supplies, diversifying supply and reducing reliance on any one energy source. Keeping the lights on is non-negotiable.\r\n\r\nThe Government is clear that nuclear will be an important part of the future generation mix; a transition to a low carbon economy is key to our long term economic and environmental prosperity and, looking at the full costs to consumers, nuclear is both cost-competitive and low carbon. It is the only proven, large scale, low-carbon technology which provides base load supply. Currently, the UK has eight power stations which generate around 20% of electricity in the UK. Almost all of these existing power stations are due to close by 2030, and it is important we start to take action now to replace these.\r\n\r\nFollowing a review of the Hinkley Point C project, the Government has decided to proceed with the first new nuclear power station for a generation, subject to a number of conditions being accepted. Hinkley Point C will kick start a new era of nuclear power - building on Britain’s strong nuclear legacy – and help ensure the UK benefits from a diverse future energy mix designed to give consumers reliable and affordable low carbon energy. It will provide 7% of Britain’s electricity needs for 60 years. UK-based businesses will benefit from more than 60% of the £18 billion value of the project, and 26,000 jobs and apprenticeships will be created.\r\n\r\nThe Government is already committed to the renewable energy sector where it has a proven track record - nearly £52 billion has been invested since 2010. The average annual investment has more than doubled in the last 5 years, with an average of £9 billion invested each year in UK-based renewables. Annual support for renewable technologies will more than double, to over £10 billion, in 2020-21.\r\n\r\nSince 2010, the UK has more than trebled its renewable electricity capacity. Renewables’ share of generation increased by 6 percentage points on 2014 to a record 25% in 2015. For the first time, renewable sources provided more power over the year than coal. We are on track to comfortably exceed our ambition of delivering 30% of the UK’s electricity from renewables in 2020-21.\r\n  \r\nIn addition:\r\n•\tsolar PV has had rapid deployment over the past 5 years, with over 99% of the UKs capacity deployed since 2010 and almost 40% of the capacity (3.7GW) was installed in 2015\r\n•\tbio energy generation was 30% higher in 2015 compared to 2014\r\n•\toverall, wind generation was 26% higher than in 2014 and installed capacity 7.0% higher\r\n\r\nRenewables, such as wind farms, are intermittent and this is why the Government supports a balanced energy policy comprising a mix of sources, such as gas, nuclear and renewables.  With increased use of renewable energy, intermittency will become more of an issue and it is something we are planning for very carefully. We are seeking to keep energy bills down by not over incentivising technologies under low carbon incentive schemes. Furthermore, we are encouraging industry to drive down development costs, which is why the Contracts for Difference (CfD) strike price reduces over time.\r\n\r\nAs costs continue to fall, we will scale back support from sectors and redirect support to technologies where it is needed most. Onshore wind and solar costs have already fallen and so we have reduced support in those areas.\r\n\r\nThe Government is committed to providing investors with certainty and reducing risks for future investors.

Following Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC’s) inspection of firearms licensing , and their recommendation to put police guidelines on a statutory footing, clause 107 of the Policing and Crime Bill introduces a power for the Home Secretary to issue the police with statutory guidance on firearms. \r\n\r\nThis will allow existing safeguards around firearms ownership, for example background checks, medical suitability checks, and criteria around applicants with a history of domestic violence, to be enshrined in statutory guidelines. Other aspects of the existing Home Office guide will remain on a non-statutory footing. \r\n\r\nThe new statutory guidance will ensure that the highest standards of public safety are maintained. Responsible gun owners who pose no risk will continue to be granted firearms certificates by the police, as they are now. \r\n\r\nThe police must have regard to the guidance issued by the Home Secretary. Currently, because Home Office guidance is non-statutory, the police are not obliged to follow it.

Over 20 children who meet the criteria in the Immigration Act have been accepted for transfer to the UK since Royal Assent in May, the majority of whom have already arrived in the UK. As is required by the Immigration Act 2016, we are consulting with local authorities to confirm available capacity and to ensure appropriate support systems are in place. We are in active discussions with the UNHCR, UNICEF, NGOs and the Italian, Greek and French governments to strengthen and speed up mechanisms to identify, assess and transfer children who meet the criteria to the UK where this in their best interests.\r\n\r\nWe have always been clear that we want to support family reunification as much as possible.
