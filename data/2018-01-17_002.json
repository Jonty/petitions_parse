Based on expert advice, it offers protection to those at highest risk.","details":"Vaccination saves lives – it prevents disease, disability and death. It is a vital way to protect children (and others) against a range of serious diseases and we strongly encourage families to take up vaccinations when offered. \r\n\r\nAll our vaccination programmes are based on expert review of the evidence from the Joint Committee on Vaccination \u0026 Immunisation (JCVI) – it bases its recommendations on a comprehensive review of a wide range of scientific and other evidence, including from the published literature, and commissioned studies such as independent analyses of vaccine effectiveness and cost effectiveness. https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/joint-committee-on-vaccination-and-immunisation\r\n\r\nMen B is a terrible disease and the Department would like to extend its deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Layla Rose Ermenekli. However, the UK MenB vaccination programme is based on the advice of the JCVI.  The JCVI recommended that MenB immunisation should be routinely offered to the group of children at the highest risk, and reviewed all available evidence in determining their advice.\r\n\r\nTheir advice is summarised in the following statement:\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/meningococcal-b-vaccine-jcvi-position-statement\r\n\r\nFollowing JCVI’s recommendation, the UK is proud to have been the first country to introduce a national, publically funded MenB immunisation programme for infants using the Bexsero® vaccine. Since September 2015, all infants aged two months have been offered the MenB vaccine, followed by a second dose at four months and a booster at 12 months. Since May 2017, all children under two have become eligible for vaccination. The vaccine is also available to a small number of older children and adults who are at an increased risk of infection, such as those with specific underlying medical conditions. \r\n\r\nThe JCVI keeps the eligibility criteria of all vaccination programmes under review and considers new evidence as it emerges. The JCVI has considered older age groups (1-4 year olds) but did not advise a catch up programme. The JCVI have also requested further research to reduce uncertainty and give a greater level of confidence on whether a vaccination programme for adolescents would be cost effective. Specifically, the JCVI have requested a study of the effect of MenB vaccination on the carriage of meningococcal strains in adolescents. An open competition process has been carried out, and completed, to commission this work, which the selected research team could potentially begin by the end of 2017.\r\n\r\nMenB is, thankfully, very rare and incidence has been declining since 2000/2001. There were about 1,600 cases of MenB in 2000/01 compared to 444 MenB cases in 2015/16 and the vaccine protects against the majority of MenB strains for infants and those who are at risk of meningococcal disease. \r\n\r\nThere are, however, strains of group B meningococcal bacteria which are not covered by the vaccine and cases can still occur in vaccinated infants and children. It is therefore very important for parents to be alert to the symptoms of meningococcal disease such as fever, blotchy skin, refusal to feed, irritability, cold hands and feet, rash, muscle pain, and a stiff body with jerky movements or else floppy and lifeless. Parents should trust their instincts and seek urgent medical attention if they have concerns. Further information is available publically on the NHS choices website; https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Meningitis/Pages/Introduction.aspx \r\n\r\nPublic Health England (PHE) has been collaborating with charities about how best to help parents understand the signs and symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia. This includes providing  funding to the charities to deliver a package of activities, including distributing materials to highlight the most common signs of meningitis in babies and toddlers and digital promotion of a ‘Meningitis Signs and Symptoms’ app to educate parents.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2017-10-23T15:46:31.293Z","updated_at":"2017-10-23T15:46:31.293Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":202302,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/202302.json"},"attributes":{"action":"To create a law for road side safety when recovering vehicles.","background":"to create a law to make people slow down or move over for vehicles that have broken down or accidents etc on the roadside...","additional_details":"Due to the increase of fatalities and serious injury whilst recovering vehicles on  the roadside we must increase safety procedures in place for the roadside recovery drivers.","state":"open","signature_count":11687,"created_at":"2017-10-06T13:49:17.693Z","updated_at":"2018-01-16T19:42:12.698Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-10-10T08:44:43.769Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-10-06T15:40:00.363Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2017-10-17T08:51:02.815Z","government_response_at":"2017-10-30T16:12:04.200Z","debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Stanley Peter Gallears","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"The Government considers there is robust regulation in place that includes provisions for the safety of workers on the roadside, including roadside recovery drivers.","details":"Ensuring the safety of anyone working on our roads is just as important as ensuring the safety of those travelling on them. In areas identified as especially high risk, such as the hard shoulder on motorways, the Department for Transport placed a specific responsibility on Highways England, under the Infrastructure Act 2015, to have due regard to the need to protect and improve the safety of the strategic road network as a whole for all road users. This includes ensuring that roadside vehicle recovery operations are safe for both recovery drivers and all other road users. \r\n\r\nAs a first step towards this goal, the Government set a challenging target. Highways England has a target to reduce those killed or seriously injured on their strategic road network, of a decrease of at least 40% by the end of 2020 against the 2005-09 average baselines. Further details on Highways England’s Health \u0026 Safety 5 year plan is available on the Highways England website: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/highways-england-health-and-safety.\r\n\r\nRules 219 and 281 of the Highway Code provide for emergency and incident support vehicles and their corresponding warning signs or flashing lights. These rules advise drivers to be aware of emergency or incident support vehicles on the road: it provides advice on which warning lights or signals these vehicles use, and advises drivers to exercise extra care and attention including slowing down, being prepared to stop, and to follow any directions given by police officers, or traffic officers, as to whether drivers can safely pass an incident or blockage.\r\n\r\nWhether on the strategic road network or on local roads, the police already have powers to deal with road users who do not slow down or move over for vehicles that have broken down or been involved in accidents on the roadside. Road users, are required to comply with road traffic law in the interests of their own safety and that of other road users. If road users do not adopt a responsible attitude, or if their use of the highway creates an unsafe environment or causes a nuisance, they may be committing a number of offences. For example, under sections 2 and 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (as amended) a person may be charged with the offences of dangerous driving, or careless and inconsiderate driving. In each case it is for the police to enforce the law.\r\n\r\nThe Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 also requires employers to ensure the safety of their employees during the course of their work. HSE would expect that employers have arrangements in place to ensure that safe working procedures are used, vehicles and equipment of an appropriate standard are provided and maintained, where necessary, appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) is provided and used, and all persons have been adequately trained by a competent person on how to work safely at the roadside and the precautions they should be recommending to the occupants of incident support vehicles.

These are co-ordinated across education, health and care, and involve children and young people and their families throughout the process.\r\n\r\nThese measures aim to reduce health inequalities and improve outcomes for children and young people with SEND and their families.  \r\n\r\nWe recognise that having ADHD can lead people to experience mental health problems and the Government is committed to improving mental health support and services. We have increased funding for mental health services by 8.4% since 2014/15 and last year, spend was the highest ever at £11.6bn.  \r\n\r\nWe have also commissioned NICE and the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health (NCCMH) to improve mental health service pathways and tackle variations in provision. NHS England’s ‘Standard for Mental Health Investment’ ensures that NHS investment in mental health increases year on year. \r\n\r\nThe Government has introduced the Children and Young People’s Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme (CYP IAPT) which aims to improve Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). 90% of the 0-18 population are covered by this change programme and we are on course to reach 100% by 2018. \r\n\r\nWhilst we recognise the need to continue to improve support for people with ADHD, we believe the existing statutory framework provides the scope to achieve this and have no current plans to introduce a specific Act of Parliament. \r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2017-12-04T16:21:37.912Z","updated_at":"2017-12-04T16:21:37.912Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":205388,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/205388.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Repeal the Vagrancy Act 1824","background":"The Vagrancy Act 1824 makes it an offence to sleep rough or beg.\r\n\r\nIt is a barbaric, archaic law that criminalises the very existence of those homeless forced to take to the streets or beg for survival. \r\n\r\nScotland \u0026 Ireland removed this outdated law decades ago - England \u0026 Wales must join them.","additional_details":"Though created almost two centuries ago, recent years have seen the Vagrancy Act abused in absurd and unnecessary ways.

It is important that the police are able to quickly and easily identify a vehicle and people are able to remember registration numbers.  To this end, the law requires that number plates are clearly readable.\r\n\r\nThe rules regarding what can be displayed on a number plate, including any optional national flags, are specified in UK law.  These rules help to ensure safety on our roads.  They support the police and other enforcement agencies in identifying vehicles to prevent and detect crime particularly through the use of Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to displaying the registration number, the law provides for the voluntary use of the display of the European Union flag (the circle of stars) or specific national identifiers.  The display of the European flag with the inclusion of a GB identifier, called the Europlate, enables motorists to travel within the European Union without the need to display the conventional oval ‘GB’ sticker to identify the member state in which the vehicle is registered.  Currently, UK motorists travelling within the EU can display either the traditional oval GB sticker or the Europlate.  No decisions have yet been taken on the status of the Europlate after the UK leaves the EU. \r\n\r\nThe law was changed in 2009 to also allow the voluntary display of UK national flags.  This means that motorists are able to choose to display the Union Flag, the Cross of St George, Scottish Saltire or the Red Dragon of Wales on their number plate.   However, it is entirely a matter of personal choice whether to display a national flag on a number plate and no one is compelled to do so.  There are no plans to make the display of the Union flag on vehicle number plates compulsory. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-09T13:54:51.269Z","updated_at":"2018-01-09T13:54:51.269Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":204079,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/204079.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Ban Isis fighters from returning to the UK","background":"Anybody who has left this country to join ISIS should not be allowed to return.","additional_details":"We the people of the UK have a right to live safely without fear of Isis fighters returning to attack us.
