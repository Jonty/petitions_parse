The advantages of 112 are that it is a GPS service.  People who are trying to contact emergency services do not need to know where they are as the 112 service can pin point their location.  Also, people can register their phone number to text an emergency message to 112.  This is crucial in areas where a phone signal is not possible.  The text will get through.","state":"open","signature_count":26,"created_at":"2018-04-08T11:24:47.572Z","updated_at":"2018-04-18T21:00:17.377Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-04-16T16:02:06.862Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-04-10T06:32:47.466Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Malcolm Edward Sweetlove","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":216901,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/216901.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Male \u0026 Female employees should be treated the same when on shared parental leave","background":"Because of the Equality Act 2010 woman and men should have the same company benefits as equal pay.\r\nAt the moment companies can offer a enhanced maternity pay that benefits only women can opt not to offer the same benefits to male employees wanting to take Shared Paternal Leave.","additional_details":"At the moment there isn't any legal requirement, with some cases people making a claim that they are being treated less favourable than women on the same company and/or job, some being successful and some not.\r\nSome companies use the technicality that male employee on shared parental leave is treated no less favourably than a female employee on shared parental leave while they offer enhaced maternity pay a benefit only available to womans.","state":"open","signature_count":26,"created_at":"2018-04-05T10:28:05.669Z","updated_at":"2018-04-17T19:57:53.336Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-04-12T14:33:23.214Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-04-05T13:58:37.978Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Nicolas Nilles","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":211311,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/211311.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Create an age limit and a license for all dog owners","background":"Hoping to change the law so that anyone who wants to own a dog has to be 21 plus and also have to buy a license for dogs deemed 'bad breeds' such as bull mastiffs, bull dogs, staffies to stop idiotic people from having 'easy' access to these dogs.","additional_details":"In may 2017 a family pet was mauled by 3 big dogs, described as bull mastiff, pit bull and staffordshire bull terrier dogs, the family pet was a king charles cavalier which stood no chance against these 3 massive dogs, but somehow the dog survived.
