So the tax rate goes from 40% for earnings under £100,000, up to 60%, and then back down to 40% for earnings between £123,000 and £150,000. Truly bizzare.","additional_details":"This tax rate is a clear disincentive for those earning around £100,000 (mainly those seen as \"wealth creators\"). So much so that the vast majority will surely act to avoid this rate (e.g. By paying into their pensions). This is dragging liquidity away from the market and therefore adversely affecting everyone in the country.","state":"open","signature_count":6,"created_at":"2017-10-04T19:08:53.523Z","updated_at":"2017-10-23T17:13:12.416Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-10-23T17:13:12.413Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-10-18T17:11:14.669Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Usman Hamid","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":200589,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200589.json"},"attributes":{"action":"To made possible to claim disability discrimination when applying for a school.","background":"Currently, the law prevents to make an appeal on disability discrimination case against Local Authority when they fail to secure a place at chosen school.
