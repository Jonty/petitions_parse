The assessment is nothing more than unnecessary bureaucracy that usually ends in refusal for PIP. I would also like to make the RT Hon Damian Green MP aware that the assessors that carry out these assessments do take advantage of an autistic person's disability to ensure they dont score any points in the assessment and refuse them PIP. If the RT Hon Damian Green would like more detail I am available to talk about it.","state":"open","signature_count":22,"created_at":"2016-10-25T13:57:36.584Z","updated_at":"2016-11-11T18:05:25.123Z","open_at":"2016-11-04T17:50:28.530Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2016-10-29T00:57:30.372Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"creator_name":"Wesley Faulkner","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":170229,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/170229.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make diagnosed medical need the same as disability for discrimination laws","background":"As someone suffering from diagnosed coeliac disease, I am appalled that there is no legislation which protects our rights (and those with other medically diagnosed conditions) from discrimination, unless that diagnosis happens to be recognised as a disability in law.","additional_details":"Whilst restaurants, cafes and other public bodies and places have to make reasonable adjustments for people with disability, there is no requirement for them to do likewise for a medically diagnosed condition, such as diabetes and coeliac disease.\r\n\r\nHospitals often fail to provide any gluten free menu options for coeliacs and despite NICE guidelines, the NHS trusts are withdrawing prescriptions for gluten free food, the only treatment for coeliacs (yet still prescribe food for other conditions).","state":"open","signature_count":22,"created_at":"2016-10-24T18:16:35.473Z","updated_at":"2016-11-04T09:30:07.354Z","open_at":"2016-10-31T15:07:40.855Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2016-10-24T19:37:07.507Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"creator_name":"Richard Alan Mellor","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":168266,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/168266.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make it compulsory for schools with social media accounts to be set to private.","background":"The primary school my children attend has a public Twitter profile that they post photos of the children on. 3 explicit Twitter profiles have retweeted and liked a photo of my child.
