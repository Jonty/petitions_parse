A further rise in the rate of standard UK IPT was announced recently. From 1st June 2017 IPT charged on charities' insurance premiums increased to 12%. This represents a 100% increase in an 18 month period. These increases have and will continue to negatively affect charities who have already suffered in the last few years from reduced income while seeing an increase in the demand for their services.","state":"open","signature_count":6,"created_at":"2017-12-13T17:53:53.380Z","updated_at":"2017-12-18T18:10:03.797Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-12-18T18:10:03.793Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-12-14T08:01:34.380Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Simon Hickman","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}}]}
