Therefore the Government considers that a public inquiry into this tragic case is not necessary.","details":"The murder of Jamie Bulger was an appalling crime which shocked the nation and, 25 years on, continues to be of huge interest and concern. Our deepest sympathies remain with Mrs Fergus and Mr Bulger for the pain and suffering they have endured. \r\n\r\nBecause this case has been of such understandable concern, when the man formerly known as Jon Venables was recalled to custody in February 2010, the then Justice Secretary asked Sir David Omand, the former Permanent Secretary at the Home Office, to conduct an extensive review of the management of Venables from the time of his release from Red Bank Secure Children’s Home in 2001 until his recall to custody. In July 2010 Venables was convicted of possessing, downloading and sharing indecent images of children, and Sir David’s detailed report was published in November 2010 and can be found at the following link: https://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/publications/corporate-reports/MoJ/2010/omand-review-web.pdf \r\n\r\nThe independent Parole Board directed Venables’ re-release on life licence – subject to strict licence conditions in July 2013 after a thorough risk assessment and in accordance with the statutory release test, which is whether it is necessary on the grounds of public protection for the offender to be detained in custody. The Parole Board is legally not allowed to share the reasons behind any of its release decisions, but the Government last month announced an urgent review into how to increase the transparency of Parole-Board decision-making and whether and how it might be possible to challenge those decisions.\r\n\r\nUnlike in 2010, Jon Venables’ recent criminal acts were discovered as a direct result of the tight monitoring to which he was subject by the Police and Probation Services. He has also constantly been subject to stricter licence conditions and more scrutiny than most lifers would be at the same stage of their sentence. For that reason, a review of the management of Venables since 2010 would not have the same clear focus. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, the Government’s number one priority is public safety so we will of course keep the monitoring practice under constant review. Venables is now serving a sentence of 40 months’ imprisonment for possessing indecent images of children. Once he has completed the custodial part of that sentence, he will remain in custody until the independent Parole Board determines that his risk is such that he may be re-released on life licence.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Justice","created_at":"2018-02-14T14:06:36.907Z","updated_at":"2018-02-14T14:06:36.907Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":216539,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/216539.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Amnesty for anyone who was a minor that arrived In Britain between 1948 to 1971","background":"Windrush Generation were invited as settlers and as British subjects.

It also retained a right of abode for certain Commonwealth citizens. Therefore, everyone that arrived in the UK and was settled before 1973 was given settlement rights by operation of law and was not required to have any specific documentation to prove those rights. \r\n\r\nSince 1973, many of the Windrush generation will have obtained documentation confirming their status or would have applied for citizenship and then a British passport. For those who have not, the former Home Secretary announced a series of measures on 16 and 23 April 2018 to ensure the Windrush generation could easily obtain documentation to demonstrate that right and could easily go on to apply for British Citizenship.\r\n \r\nOn 16 April, the previous Home Secretary announced a dedicated taskforce would be established to support the Windrush generation. The taskforce is taking calls and emails from those who are affected and guiding them through the application taskforce. Since its inception on 17 April the taskforce has documented hundreds of individuals who were affected.\r\n\r\nIn the Westminster Hall debate on this petition, the Minister for Immigration said of the taskforce:\r\n\r\nI was in Croydon and in Sheffield with caseworkers who are on the frontline, doing their best to help people through the process. \r\n\r\nI have to say that I was very impressed with the determination of those caseworkers to be sympathetic and understanding, and to talk people through the process as gently as they possibly could while at the same time enabling them to give their stories and to provide a picture of their life in the UK—helping them through a process with which we should have been helping them much earlier.\r\n\r\nOn 23 April, the previous Home Secretary announced four measures to assist those in the Windrush generation to become British Citizens:\r\n\r\nFirstly, that the Government will waive the citizenship fee for anyone in the Windrush generation who wishes to apply for citizenship. This applies to those who have no current documentation, and also to those who have it.\r\n\r\nSecondly, that the Government will waive the requirement to carry out a Knowledge of Language and Life in the UK test for British Citizenship.\r\n\r\nThirdly, that the children of the Windrush generation who are in the UK and need to apply for naturalisation will have their fee waived.  For those not born in the UK but now living here, provided they joined their parents as children (before the age of 18) they will also be covered by the scheme.\r\n\r\nFourthly, that those who made their lives here but have now retired to their country of origin, are able to come back to the UK, without fees. \r\n\r\nFinally, the Prime Minister and Home Secretary have announced that a compensation scheme will be put in place for those who have suffered loss as a result of these difficulties, and that the Government will consult on the design of this scheme – such as the shape it should take, what it should cover, and how long it should be for. \r\n \r\nAccordingly, the Home Office have launched a call for evidence addressed to those who have been affected by this situation and their families.  This is an opportunity for those people to tell the Government what happened, how it has affected them and what they believe the compensation scheme needs to address.\r\n\r\nAs a first step the Government have asked Martin Forde QC to provide independent oversight and advise us on the design of the scheme. He will help us to understand the experience of people who have been affected and how this should be reflected in the scheme.\r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2018-05-23T11:50:21.008Z","updated_at":"2018-05-23T11:50:21.008Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":"2018-04-30","transcript_url":"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2018-04-30/debates/CEC6AAFF-E02D-41DA-B681-AF9713BE6F82/MinorsEnteringTheUK1948To1971","video_url":"https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/f29d6e8b-ff66-4e9b-97a6-89dc46a9dbfd","debate_pack_url":"https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CDP-2018-0109","overview":""}}},{"type":"petition","id":209433,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/209433.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Give the electorate a referendum on the abolition of the House of Lords","background":"The House of Lords is a place of patronage where unelected and unaccountable individuals hold a disproportionate amount of influence and power which can be used to frustrate the elected representatives of the people","additional_details":"","state":"open","signature_count":168057,"created_at":"2018-01-12T13:08:04.466Z","updated_at":"2018-06-09T22:53:12.953Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-01-17T18:36:38.185Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-01-12T14:54:34.514Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2018-04-18T22:00:48.770Z","government_response_at":"2018-05-15T16:42:14.496Z","debate_threshold_reached_at":"2018-04-23T22:32:25.308Z","scheduled_debate_date":"2018-06-18","debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Robert McBride","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"The Government is committed to ensuring that the House of Lords continues to fulfil its constitutional role as a revising and scrutinising chamber which respects the primacy of the House of Commons.

In line with current NICE clinical guidance, women with uncomplicated pregnancies should usually be offered induction of labour between 41+0 and 42+0 weeks to avoid the risks of prolonged pregnancy. Decisions on induction of labour should also take into account women’s preferences and local circumstances.

The Secretary of State’s ambition is to halve the national rates of stillbirths, neonatal and maternal deaths and brain injuries occurring during or soon after birth by 2025, with a 20% reduction in these rates by 2020. A second ambition is to reduce the national pre-term birth rate from 8% to 6% by 2025.  \r\n\r\nNHS England’s Maternity Transformation Programme supports the Secretary of State’s ambitions, and recommends that all NHS Trusts with maternity services implement ‘Saving Babies’ Lives: A Care Bundle for Reducing Stillbirth’, published in March 2016. The Care Bundle guidance brings together four key elements of care based on the best available evidence and clinical practice, including reducing smoking in pregnancy; risk assessment and surveillance for fetal growth restriction; raising awareness of reduced fetal movement; and effective fetal monitoring during labour. During 2018/19, NHS trusts with maternity services have been asked to demonstrate compliance with all 4 elements of the ‘Saving Babies’ Lives’ care bundle as part of the Clinical Negligence for Trusts Scheme administered by NHS Resolution. Further information on this is available here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safer-maternity-care-progress-and-next-steps (see page 32 of Maternity Safety Strategy 2017).\r\n \r\nAn academic study by University of Manchester, evaluating the efficacy of the Care Bundle in 20 hospital sites will be published later in 2018.

We want to enable disabled people to have the same opportunities and choices as non-disabled people. We have, therefore, designed Personal Independence Payment (PIP) to reflect a modern understanding of disability, treating all conditions fairly.\r\n\r\nPIP maintains the key principles of Disability Living Allowance as a non-means-tested cash benefit available to people in and out of work but which is delivered in a fairer and more consistent manner. It is only right that support is targeted at those disabled people who require the most assistance to lead independent lives and PIP is achieving that; 29 per cent of the 1.6 million claimants now receiving PIP getting it at the highest level (£143.35 a week) compared to 15 per cent for working age Disability Living Allowance prior to the introduction of PIP.\r\n\r\nPIP is needs-based and not condition based and reviews are a key part of the benefit to ensure that the right support continues to be delivered. \r\n\r\nIn terms of award lengths and reviews, once someone has been awarded PIP, which can be paid at one of eight rates, that award will be reviewed. Reviews of PIP are a key part of the benefit and ensure that not only do awards remain correct where needs may change but that we also maintain contact with the claimant, both features missing from its predecessor Disability Living Allowance. Importantly, the length of an award is based on an individual’s circumstances and can vary from nine months to an on-going award, with a light touch review at the ten year point. \r\n\r\nHowever, PIP already recognises that for the most severely disabled claimants, the award review process could seem unnecessarily intrusive. That is why we introduced changes so that existing claimants with the most severe, lifetime disabilities, whose functional ability has remained the same, are more likely to have their evidence reviewed by a DWP Decision Maker and will not need to have a face-to-face assessment with a healthcare professional.\r\n\r\nThe Government are committed to ensuring that the PIP reassessment process works effectively across the spectrum of disabilities and health conditions, including mental health conditions, cognitive impairments and physical disabilities.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, one of our key priorities will be to ensure that those  with progressive or degenerative conditions for which functional limitation is likely to stay the same or worsen who are awarded the highest level of support get an award duration that is appropriate to the condition and needs arising – something we acknowledge that is not always happening.

It could also encourage more migrants to attempt to enter or stay in the country illegally in the hope that they would be treated similarly. This additional risk of encouraging further illegal migration could potentially endanger individuals and their families by placing them in the hands of unscrupulous traffickers. \r\n\r\nImmigration Rules have been designed to be fair and to treat people with respect and dignity, but also firm with those who do not abide by the Rules, and that ensure people come to the UK for the right reasons – to work hard and contribute to our economy and society. \r\n\r\nIt is important that we distinguish between those who are here legally and those who are here illegally. We recognise the devastating consequences that illegal migration can have on individuals who become vulnerable to exploitation. We are committed to tackling the organised crime groups who profit from illegal migration and protecting those who are at risk of exploitation.   \r\nThere are routes available for individuals who believe they have a right to remain in the UK on the basis of family or private life, or other human rights grounds. Those who wish to can apply under the Immigration Rules and each application is considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the individual circumstances. \r\n\r\nIt is important that there are clear incentives to comply with the Immigration Rules. This means for example that private life established here while a person is in the UK unlawfully or while their immigration status is precarious should be accorded little weight.

However, our 25 Year Environment Plan sets out measures to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste.","details":"There are no current plans to ban all non-recyclable packaging from 2022. However, the Government’s 25 Year Environment Plan sets out measures to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste. We will do this through a four-point plan that takes action at each stage of the product lifecycle – production, consumption and end of life. At the production stage, this includes encouraging producers to take more responsibility for the environmental impact of their products and making sure plastic items are more carefully designed. At the consumer stage we want to reduce demand for single-use plastic. At the end of life stage, we will make it easier for people to recycle and increase the amount of plastic being recycled. \r\n\r\nMore detail, including future targets and milestones, will be announced in the forthcoming Resources and Waste Strategy.  \r\nWe know that our producer responsibility waste management systems as they currently stand could be improved. That is why we have already committed in both our Clean Growth Strategy and our 25 Year Environment Plan to reforming the current systems to incentivise producers to take greater responsibility for the environmental impacts of their products, and to drive resource efficiency and increase the recycling of packaging waste.\r\n\r\nThe government has also confirmed that it will introduce a Deposit Return Scheme in England for single-use drinks containers, subject to consultation later this year. The consultation will look at the details of how such a scheme would work, alongside other measures to increase recycling rates.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the government has launched a call for evidence seeking views on how the tax system or charges could reduce the waste from single use plastics. The closing date is 18 May 2018 and it can be found at: www.gov.uk/government/consultations/tackling-the-plastic-problem.\r\n\r\nWorking through the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), the Government is developing and delivering activities in support of the use of recycled materials in new products and activities to stimulate its demand. In September 2016, WRAP and an industry advisory group published a framework for greater consistency in recycling. Actions from this framework aim to identify opportunities to rationalise packaging formats (in particular plastic packaging) to those that are recyclable and for which there is a steady market, and to help local authorities to recycle a greater variety of plastics.\r\nThe government is committed to increasing recycling rates. Current policies and regulations have resulted in a significant increase in recycling over the last decade, with recycling of packaging rising from around 57.5% in 2006 to 64.7% in 2016, but we recognise that more needs to be done. We will continue to work with businesses, local authorities and waste managers to encourage the use of recycled materials where possible in products and activities to stimulate demand.\r\n\r\nAlmost all packaging materials are in theory recyclable. However, in practice, not all may be recycled for a number of reasons: for example it may not be economically viable for a local council to collect and recycle some formats; local reprocessing infrastructure may be limited, and there may be a lack of end markets for some types of recycled materials.\r\nPackaging has an important and positive role to play in reducing product damage, food waste and consumer safety. Keeping food fresher for longer through innovations such as vacuum packing and re-sealable packs has a significant impact on extending the life of products and reducing waste. If a product is wasted due to insufficient packaging then its disposal often has a greater environmental impact than the packaging itself. \r\n\r\nRetailers and their suppliers are encouraged to use materials that are widely collected for recycling wherever possible. For example, The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations place a legal obligation on large UK businesses that make or use packaging to ensure that a proportion of the packaging they place on the market is recovered and recycled. This creates an incentive for companies to use less packaging and to ensure that their packaging can be recycled at end of life as it will reduce their costs in complying with the Regulations. We have also set rising targets for business up to 2020, which will continue to increase the amount of packaging waste recycled.\r\n\r\nBusinesses are also required to reduce waste arising in the first place by using appropriately sized packaging. The Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations require businesses to ensure that all packaging does not exceed what is needed to make sure that the products are safe, hygienic and acceptable for both the packed product and for the consumer. These Regulations apply to those responsible for the packing or filling of products into packaging and those importing packed or filled packaging into the UK from elsewhere.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","created_at":"2018-04-20T12:24:24.987Z","updated_at":"2018-05-22T14:24:18.123Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":215415,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/215415.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make anti-GD2 treatment available on the NHS","background":"Neuroblastoma is an aggressive cancer which mainly affects children under the age of 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnti GD2 therapy is standard in the US but is not available on the NHS.

Breast cancer can be a devastating disease and the Government is committed to providing well-managed screening programmes based on the most current peer reviewed evidence to ensure the greatest benefit.\r\n \r\nA screening programme is introduced following a robust process using peer reviewed evidence that shows the benefits to screen clearly outweigh harm and they are subject to central programme specifications and quality assurance. The English cancer screening programmes are internationally renowned for their rigour, standard of evidence, national implementation and quality assurance.\r\n \r\nThe NHS Breast Screening Programme (NHS BSP) in England offers all women between the ages of 50 and 70 the opportunity to be screened every 3 years for breast cancer, to help detect abnormalities and reduce the number of lives lost to invasive breast cancer.  The NHS BSP aims to detect breast cancer early when there is a greater chance of cure.  \r\n \r\nAlthough early detection is the best way to reduce breast cancer mortality by giving the opportunity to offer women more treatment options, which may save lives, there are also risks. These include over-diagnosis (referring for unnecessary tests) and over-treatment (operating on disease that is unlikely to cause serious harm).  For women under the age of 50, there is evidence that breast screening is less effective, as younger women have less fatty, denser breast tissue.  Screening with mammography (x-rays) is the technique that is evidence-based and can detect cancers at an early stage.  However, they are not very effective in diagnosing disease in younger women with dense breasts. Breast screening is offered from the age of 50 as the chance of developing the disease increases with age.  Four out of five breast cancers develop in women over the age of 50. There is insufficient evidence to confidently offer breast screening to women at a much younger age as doing so will find many abnormalities which will be treated but would never have developed into a cancer. This can cause harm and anxiety.  Not all breast cancers can be detected early when they are non-invasive and some women with non-invasive disease would never have cancer during their lifetime. \r\n \r\nThere are several trials in the Programme addressing these issues currently:\r\n•\tForget me not www.sloaneproject.co.uk/NonTreatmentStudy.htm  \r\n•\tLoris www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/find-a-clinical-trial/a-trial-comparing-surgery-with-active-monitoring-for-low-risk-dcis-loris\r\n•\t Sloane www.sloaneproject.co.uk/. \r\n \r\nThe 2012 UK independent review of breast cancer screening (Marmot review) estimated that inviting women between the ages of 50-70 reduces mortality from breast cancer in the population invited by 20% and saves an estimated 1,300 lives a year.  It also found that screening women outside the ages of 50 to 70 years could lead to over-diagnosis or over-treatment. The review can be found here: http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/prod_consump/groups/cr_common/@nre/@pol/documents/generalcontent/breast-screening-report.pdf \r\n \r\nIn June 2015, the World Health Organisation’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) published the findings of a review on breast cancer screening in the New England Journal of Medicine. A group of 29 independent international experts from 16 countries, convened by the IARC, assessed the cancer-preventive and adverse effects of various methods of screening for breast cancer. The findings of the review support the current age at which women are first invited for breast screening in England and the 3 year interval period between invitations. The IARC’s review found limited evidence for the effectiveness of screening women in the younger age group of 40 to 49. Women over 70 are not routinely invited for breast screening as there is no evidence to support this, although they can self-refer every 3 years if they wish. You review can be accessed here: www.iarc.fr/en/mediacentre/pr/2015/pdfs/pr234_E.pdf\r\n\r\nWomen that are identified as being at high risk of the disease (e.g. due to a genetic mutation such as BRCA1/2 or having had supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy at a young age) can be referred into the programme at a younger age. However, for this younger cohort, screening is usually performed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which is a more suitable screening test than mammography alone.\r\nWe encourage all women to be breast aware and anyone with concerns should discuss these with their GP.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care","created_at":"2018-05-15T11:21:33.481Z","updated_at":"2018-05-15T11:21:33.481Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":211232,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/211232.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make GMC a tax-payer funded organisation and not to be funded by doctors.","background":"The GMC has been an independent regulatory body which has been funded by doctors paying Annual retention fees.

We are clear that if child abuse takes place it must be thoroughly and properly investigated and those responsible brought to justice – the race, age or gender of the perpetrators is irrelevant.  Child sexual exploitation is not exclusive to any single culture, community, race or religion, and political or cultural sensitivities must not get in the way of preventing and uncovering it. \r\n\r\nThe Government is clear there should be an honest open debate on child sexual exploitation, including racial motivation.\r\n\r\nIn February 2017, the Government  published the ‘Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation: Progress Report’ and announced a £40 million package of measures to protect children and young people from sexual abuse and exploitation and crack down on offenders.  The ‘Progress Report’ details delivery of the ambitious programme of work set out in the 2015 ‘Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation’ report, and signals a step change in our national response to sexual exploitation and violence against children and young people. The full report can be found at: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tackling-child-sexual-exploitation-progress-report. \r\n\r\nKey Actions include:\r\n  \r\n•\tWe have invested significantly in the law enforcement response to child sexual abuse, giving it the status of a national threat to empower police forces to apply their best skills and expertise to tackle the problem, and providing millions of pounds of investment through the Police Transformation Fund. This has led to a surge in police activity with an increasing number of cases prosecuted in the courts and heavy sentences handed down. We have invested in the frontline response to child sexual abuse, for example recruiting an extra 100 specialist rape and child sexual abuse prosecutors, establishing new investigative teams in the National Crime Agency, and launching a new Child Sexual Exploitation Response Unit to support social care, health and other agencies.  Our new £7.5 million Centre of Expertise on Child Sexual Abuse is conducting research into types of offending, so that we can understand and target them more effectively.\r\n\r\n•\tWe have funded a large scale communications campaign – Together, we can tackle child abuse – to raise awareness and encourage the public to report child abuse and neglect.  Additionally, we have published a revised definition of child sexual exploitation and targeted guidance and training, which will ensure professionals have a shared understanding of what child sexual exploitation is and how best to work together to tackle it. \r\n\r\n•\tWe have improved scrutiny through joint inspections of health, police and children’s social care focusing on the quality of frontline practice in dealing with child sexual exploitation and missing children. We have also launched a new national whistleblowing helpline, operated by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), for any employee who wants to raise a concern about how their organisation is dealing with a concern about a child. \r\n\r\n•\tIn the last 3 years, we have provided £7 million in funding for non statutory organisations which support the victims and survivors of sexual abuse, including child sexual abuse, £0.6 million of this funding was distributed directly by the Home Office to organisations working with victims and survivors of sexual abuse over a large geographic area.\r\n \r\nIn March 2015, the Government established the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse to consider the extent to which institutions in England and Wales have failed in their duty to protect children from sexual abuse and exploitation.  The Inquiry operates independently of Government and, within its terms of reference, decides for itself what it investigates and how.  It has already announced an investigation into institutional responses to the sexual exploitation of children by organised networks.  The Inquiry also runs a Truth Project to enable victims and survivors of child sexual abuse to share their experiences in a confidential setting and make recommendations for change.  The Inquiry’s work will help us all to understand what went wrong in the past and learn lessons for the future.

We want to enable disabled people to have the same opportunities and choices as non-disabled people. We are also committed to ensuring those with health conditions and disabilities are assessed fairly for Personal Independence Payment (PIP) and Employment Support Allowance (ESA) to ensure they receive the right level of support. \r\n\r\nPIP, which can be paid at one of eight rates, provides a non-contributory, non means-tested, tax free contribution towards the extra costs that people with long-term health conditions and disabilities face and is based on the impact of conditions and impairments on individuals’ everyday lives.\r\n\r\nESA provides financial support to those that face barriers to work. The Work Capability Assessment (WCA) for ESA focuses on the functional capability of claimants to work and on the impact of mental health conditions on functional capability. The premise of the WCA is that eligibility for benefits should not be based on a person’s condition, but rather on the way that condition limits their ability to function. \r\n\r\nThe assessments for both PIP and ESA were developed using multi-layered processes involving disabled people, representatives of disabled people and health professionals. Individual disability assessments are carried out by suitably trained Healthcare Professionals working within a quality assured, managed environment. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has set clear requirements on the professions, skills, experience and training of the Healthcare Professionals that our assessment providers can use to carry out PIP and ESA assessments and all are registered with an appropriate professional body such as the General Medical Council (GMC), Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) or the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC). \r\n\r\nHealthcare Professionals do not need to be an expert in a condition to assess the impact of a condition on a claimant’s (i) capability for work or work related activity in ESA, or (ii) daily living activities and mobility in PIP. The assessment is not designed to diagnose or give a clinical prognosis. Instead, the emphasis is on ensuring that the Healthcare Professionals are experts in disability analysis, focusing on the effects of health conditions and impairments on the individual claimant’s daily life. The role differs from the therapeutic role of healthcare professionals in reaching a diagnosis and/or planning treatment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their profession DWP recognises the importance of ensuring individuals also have sufficient experience, skills and training. All PIP and ESA  Healthcare Professionals must complete a comprehensive training programme approved by DWP and pass an assessment of competence before they can carry out assessments. \r\n\r\nThe National Health Service (NHS) is the national healthcare system for the UK, and is not designed to administer welfare benefits. Although doctors are responsible for issuing medical statements to patients, they are not responsible for making the decision on eligibility for benefit. For example, GPs and their representative body, the British Medical Association, have made it clear that they do not want to be guardians of the benefit system. The primary role of the GP or hospital doctor is to diagnose and treat any medical conditions that the patient presents to them and a clinician does not routinely consider the functional restrictions or disabling effects of the medical conditions that they treat. They are unlikely to have received specific training in assessing disabilities in their medical education, and may have difficulty in giving an accurate assessment or forming an opinion in relation to the functional restrictions experienced by their patient. They are also unlikely to have any knowledge of the legislative requirements in relation to benefit entitlement.  \r\n\r\nDecisions on both PIP and ESA are made by DWP Decision Makers based on the advice received from the assessment provider together with the evidence supplied by the claimant in their questionnaire and any additional evidence they submit or which has been requested.\r\n\r\nMany claimants to PIP and ESA present with life-limiting conditions meaning that some may sadly die during the course of claiming or receiving benefit. However, we don’t believe there is any causal link between claiming benefit and death.\r\n\r\nThe Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is an international human rights treaty of the United Nations (UN) intended to protect the rights and dignity of persons with Disabilities.

The introduction of such new regulation would require evidence that it will be effective. We are not aware of compelling evidence that the introduction of such provisions would have a significant deterrent effect on those who persecute wildlife. We will continue to monitor the situation in Scotland and to consider whether this approach is necessary and proportionate to assist in tackling wildlife crime in England.\r\n\r\nThe Government appreciates that many people have strongly held views on grouse shooting. The Government also recognises that shooting activities bring many benefits to the rural economy and the environment, in particular wildlife and habitat conservation. The Government therefore continues to support shooting, recognising it is vital that wildlife and habitats are respected and protected and we ensure a sustainable, mutually beneficial relationship between shooting and conservation. \r\n\r\nThe Government recognises the international importance of the UK uplands. The UK has 75 percent of the world’s remaining heather moorland and about 13 percent of the world’s blanket bog (rain-fed peat bog that ‘blankets’ the landscape). Seventy percent of the UK’s drinking water is provided from upland catchments and tourism brings in an estimated £1.78 billion to England’s upland national parks.\r\n\r\nNatural England is working with landowners of grouse moors within special areas of conservation to develop long term land management plans, which include vegetation management principles for the various habitats on grouse moors. The Government encourages land managers to work closely with Natural England to put these plans in place for all the benefits they bring to moor owners and to the environment.\r\n\r\nWith regard to grouse moorland management, grouse shooting is one of the main land uses in the uplands along with grazing and forestry. The Government recognises that healthy, active peat provides good habitat for grouse as well as numerous environmental benefits and ecosystem services. The Government is working with moor owners and stakeholders to further improve management practices and peat condition, such as through the Blanket Bog Restoration Strategy.\r\n\r\nWith regard to birds of prey, like all wild birds they are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The current legislation and guidance balances competing social, economic and environmental interests, while protecting the conservation status and welfare of the relevant bird of prey species. Some species of birds of prey need specific protection because their low numbers indicate that their populations are struggling.\r\n\r\nThe Government takes the decline in the hen harrier population in England very seriously and is committed to securing its future. In January 2016 we published the Hen Harrier Action Plan to increase the English hen harrier population. It contains six actions that individually can bring benefits for hen harriers, but when combined underpin each other and have the potential to deliver positive outcomes. \r\n\r\nThe Action Plan was developed with senior representatives from organisations including Natural England, the Moorland Association, the National Gamekeepers’ Organisation, the Game \u0026 Wildlife Conservation Trust, National Parks England and formerly the RSPB. These organisations, led by Natural England, will monitor activities and report annually on progress to the Defra Uplands Stakeholder Forum and the UK Tasking and Co-ordinating group for Wildlife Crime.\r\n\r\nRaptors, like all wild birds, are afforded protection from illegal killing by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. However, the Government is concerned that there are still individuals who continue to commit these crimes. \r\n\r\nAs a result, the Government has identified the illegal persecution of raptors as a wildlife crime priority. Each wildlife crime priority has a delivery group to consider what action should be taken, and develop a plan to prevent crime, gather intelligence on offences and enforce against it. The Raptor Persecution Priority Delivery Group is made up of representatives from Government and non-government organisations working together to help preserve and protect the six UK priority raptor species (goshawk, red kite, golden eagle, hen harrier, peregrine falcon and white tailed eagle). \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the National Wildlife Crime Unit, which is part-funded by Defra, provides valuable intelligence and operational support to police forces in tackling wildlife crimes, including raptor persecution. There are strong penalties in place to punish those committing offences against birds of prey and other wildlife. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","created_at":"2018-03-08T16:49:57.844Z","updated_at":"2018-03-08T16:49:57.844Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":220440,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/220440.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Govia Thameslink Railway should have its contract immediately removed","background":"The Secretary of State should intervene immediately over GTR's failure to implement its new timetable leaving commuters stranded and mass cancellations of services despite having a year to plan for the changes.","additional_details":"Govia Thameslink has consistently had the worst performance figures of any train operating company in England.

A patient with a disability is not discriminated against should they require a transplant, they are assessed in the same way as any other potential recipient.\r\n\r\nAll patients undergo careful assessment before being placed onto the transplant waiting list. This assessment is divided into three main questions. First, whether a patient needs a transplant or whether another more effective treatment is available. Secondly the patient’s fitness is assessed to confirm whether they are well enough to receive a transplant. A transplant operation and the associated treatment that is required to make the transplant work is reasonably risky. Sometimes the patient needs extra procedures or medication before a transplant is even possible. Sadly, some people are just not fit enough to have this life saving or life enhancing operation. Thirdly there is an assessment of whether the patient is going to be able to care for themselves (and the transplant organ) after the transplant. This third stage is treated with particular care as the medical team will need to know whether the patient is able to look after their general health and take all the necessary medication in order to avoid rejection in the new transplant. \r\n\r\nWhen a patient with a learning disability is identified as being suitable for a transplant, the key factors are ensuring that consent for transplantation is in place and that they have the correct support during post-operative care. The process by which consent is obtained will vary depending on the patient’s age (adult or child) and where they live in the UK, as different legislation will apply. Regarding post-operative care, in most circumstances the recipient’s family or carers will be very keen and supportive in giving all care that is needed after the transplant operation. Alternatively, if the patient does not have a carer, social services can often provide the support a person with a disability might need after undergoing a medical procedure. \r\n\r\nDuring the period after a patient has received a transplant, there will be a number of medications that the patient will need  to take. This includes immunosuppressants – drugs which make it much less likely that the new transplanted organ will be rejected. If a transplant recipient decides to discontinue the required post-operative medication, rejection of the organ is very likely to follow, which is why it is important that a patient receives the support they need.\r\n\r\nThere are a range of duties and supporting tools to ensure health professionals are able to support people with a learning disability. \r\n\r\nAll public bodies, including NHS organisations, must be proactive in eliminating unlawful discrimination and advancing equal opportunities, under the Equality Act. Since 1st August 2016 onwards, all organisations that provide NHS care or adult social care have been legally required to follow the Accessible Information Standard. The Standard aims to make sure that people who have a disability, impairment or sensory loss are provided with information that they can easily read and understand and with support so they can communicate effectively with health and social care services.\r\n\r\nThe Government has mandated Health Education England (HEE) to provide national leadership on education, training and workforce development in the NHS in England. Through the Mandate we will ensure that the NHS workforce is “is available in sufficient numbers and possesses the right skills, values and behaviours to deliver care and support for people with learning disabilities, autism, mental health problems and multiple and complex needs”’\r\n\r\nHEE e-Learning for Health have a programme dedicated to disability and the subject is also addressed as part of other e-learning programmes, such as those on the Accessible Information Standard, the Adolescent Health Course, Safeguarding Adults and Safeguarding Children.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Health and Social Care funded the development of Disability Matters, which was launched in February 2015, an e-learning tool providing training in understanding and supporting the needs and rights of people with a disability, developed in partnership with people with a disability and their families. https://www.disabilitymatters.org.uk/ It is a free resource for professionals in the NHS, social care and other settings who might work with people with a disability.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care","created_at":"2018-03-20T10:01:14.076Z","updated_at":"2018-04-27T15:30:36.387Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":209573,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/209573.json"},"attributes":{"action":"All jurors in rape trials to complete compulsory training about rape myths","background":"Research shows that jurors accept commonly held rape myths resulting in many incorrect not guilty verdicts.

The Government is committed to creating a safe environment in which cases can be heard and justice can be delivered.\r\n \r\nThe number of rape convictions have risen by nearly 60% in the last decade, but we know more must be done, to ensure consistent just outcomes. Active steps have been taken to ensure that rape cases are dealt with appropriately and sensitively. Crown Prosecutors and judicial office holders must undergo specialist training before they are authorised to take on rape cases. Most professionals involved in rape trials will therefore be well attuned to the challenges surrounding cases including the issues of rape myths.

They will therefore bring their own ideas and experiences to their analysis of the facts of the case. We know that rape myths exist within our society, and therefore jurors could believe these myths and that this could affect their interpretations of the facts of the case. However, there is little empirical evidence, which is needed to discern the impact of rape myths on juries and ensure that appropriate measures are taken.\r\n \r\nEnsuring that the balance is struck between jurors understanding rape myths, without encroaching on the rights to a fair trial of the defendant is not a straightforward task.

She will gather data from experienced jurors at a range of courts around the country.

Neither measure is expected to impact rent levels","details":"The Government introduced changes to finance cost relief as part of a package of measures at Summer Budget 2015 to help reduce the deficit and rebalance the economy. By restricting landlord’s finance cost relief to the basic rate of income tax we are helping to reduce the advantage landlords may have over homeowners in the property market. Income tax relief for finance costs is not available to ordinary homebuyers. It is also not available to those investing in other assets, such as shares, so we’re helping to reduce the distortion between property investment and investment in other assets.\r\n\r\nPreviously, landlords could get relief on their finance costs at their marginal rate of income tax. By restricting finance cost relief to the basic rate, all individual landlords will receive the same rate of income tax relief on their finance costs. \r\nLandlords can still claim income tax relief at their marginal rate of tax on day-to-day running costs incurred in letting out a property, such as letting agent fees and replacing furniture. Finance costs are different to other expenses as having a mortgage allows the landlord to purchase a more expensive property and incur larger gains on the investment than they would have done without it.\r\n\r\nUsing actual self-assessment data, HMRC estimate that only 1 in 5 landlords will pay more tax on their property income because of this measure. We appreciate that some of these landlords may face difficult decisions. This is why the government has chosen to act in a proportionate and gradual way. Basic rate income tax relief will still be available on all landlord's finance costs, and the government announced this change almost two years before its implementation. The restriction, introduced in April 2017, is being phased in over 4 years. This gives landlords time to adjust to the changes.\r\n\r\nGiven that only a small proportion of the housing market is affected by this change, the government does not expect it to have a large impact on either house prices or rent levels. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) also expect the impact on the housing market will be small.\r\n \r\nIn April 2016, the Government introduced higher rates of Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) for those purchasing additional properties. While it is right that people should be free to purchase a second home or invest in a buy-to-let property, the Government is aware that this can impact on other people’s ability to get on to the property ladder. The higher rates are part of the Government’s commitment to support first time buyers. Since the higher rates have been introduced, over 500,000 people have bought their first home, and first-time buyers make up an increased share of the mortgaged property market. \r\n\r\nAt Autumn Budget 2017, the Government announced further changes to permanently increase the price at which a property becomes liable to SDLT to £300,000 for first time buyers, with first-time buyers purchasing homes worth between £300,000 and £500,000 saving £5,000. This relief means that 80% of first-time buyers will not pay SDLT, and 95% of first time buyers who pay SDLT will benefit from the change. Since its introduction, 69,000 people have benefited from the relief. Over the next five years, this relief will help over a million first time buyers getting onto the housing ladder.\r\n\r\nThe Government has also taken wider action on housing to help renters get a fair deal and to address homelessness and rough sleeping. At Autumn Budget 2017, the Government committed to £2 billion of extra funding for affordable housing, including for social rented homes, bringing total investment in the Affordable Homes Programme to more than £9 billion. The Government has also allocated over £1.2 billion by 2019/20 to help reduce and prevent homelessness and rough sleeping and is implementing the Homelessness Reduction Act, which will ensure that more people get the help they need earlier to prevent them from becoming homeless in the first place. The Government aims to halve rough sleeping by 2022 and eliminate it by 2027, and has set up a Rough Sleeping and Homelessness Reduction Taskforce to develop a cross-Government strategy to work towards this commitment.\r\n\r\nHM Treasury","created_at":"2018-05-25T10:24:32.059Z","updated_at":"2018-05-25T10:24:32.059Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":212366,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/212366.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Proscribe Antifa and other left wing anarchist groups as domestic terrorists","background":"Groups such as Antifa have publicly boasted that they’re willing to use violence in the name of \"social justice\". \r\nIn 2017 confidential documents revealed that US Homeland Security officials had classified Antifa as “domestic terrorists”.

The Government is committed to using robust evidence to guide policy decisions and further measures are not ruled out.\r\n\r\nConsultations with experts from the UK and EU tyre industry revealed that tyre ageing is more complex than a simple relationship with chronological age and is related to wider issues such as tyre use and maintenance. \r\n\r\nIn seeking scientific evidence to inform the policy options, it became clear that there is limited research in this field. Therefore, in January 2018, the Department for Transport initiated a 12-month programme of independent research with the purpose of gaining a better understanding of the ageing process of tyres. This research seeks to quantify the effect of age on a tyre’s integrity, provide guidance on whether an age limit is appropriate and, if so, what that limit should be. The findings of the research will inform decisions and will be published. \r\n\r\nIn advance of the research, the Government worked with the tyre industry, the Traffic Commissioners and the vehicle operating industry to improve tyre management.  In 2014, guidance was issued to all PSV operators and to the members of the trade associations - the Confederation of Passenger Transport and the Road Haulage Association. This guidance explained how to establish the age of a tyre and included a recommendation that any tyre over 10 years of age should only be fitted as part of a twin wheel arrangement on a rear axle. This initial guidance was supplemented by a more comprehensive tyre maintenance guide, produced by the tyre industry with the support of the Senior Traffic Commissioner and the Department for Transport (the Department), aimed at ensuring good tyre maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe Department ensured that a printed copy of this guide was delivered to every PSV operator. This guidance is also available on the British Tyre Manufacturers’ Association website (http://btmauk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/October-2016-CV-TyreManagement-LINKS-270916.pdf).\r\n\r\nIn parallel, Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) enforcement staff carried out spot checks on older buses and coaches to assess the age of tyres in this segment of the national fleet. These checks were in addition to their normal enforcement programme. A year after the initial guidance was published, a further survey of older buses and coaches indicated a reduction in the average age of tyres fitted in the PSV fleet and demonstrated widespread compliance with the published advice. \r\n\r\nThe combination of guidance and enforcement has been successful to date. Official figures show that in the period between June and September 2017, the DVSA conducted 28,524 roadworthiness inspections on PSVs. Of those, approximately 0.23% failed to meet the minimum requirements for tyres set down in regulation.  Approximately 0.03% of the vehicles had tyres older than 10 years fitted to the front axle and, importantly, only four of these vehicles (approximately 0.014%) had tyres older than 11 years.

Extensive arrangements are already in place to ensure that people can access affordable prescriptions.","details":"The Government has no plans to change the list of medical conditions which provide for exemption from prescription charges. Arrangements are in place to ensure that prescriptions are affordable for everyone. Almost ninety per cent of prescription items are already free on the NHS in England and a number of prescription charge exemptions are in place, for which someone with a long-term condition like multiple sclerosis may qualify.  Exemptions principally cover those with certain medical conditions, pregnant women and new mothers, children under 16, students under the age of 19 and in qualifying full time education, anyone over 60, and those on a low income or on certain income related benefits.\r\n \r\nPeople on low incomes can apply for help with their health costs through the NHS Low Income Scheme. The Scheme provides income related help to people who are not automatically exempt from charges but who may be entitled to full or partial help if they have a low income and savings below a defined limit.\r\n\r\nAnyone who has to pay NHS prescription charges and needs prescriptions regularly or needs many prescription items can save money with a prescription prepayment certificate (PPC).  PPC holders pay no further charge at the point of dispensing and there is no limit to the number of items the holder may obtain through the certificate. There are two types of PPC – a three month PPC which costs £29.10 for three months and a twelve month PPC which costs £104 per year. A holder of a 12 month certificate can get all the prescriptions they need for just £2 per week. The quickest and easiest way to obtain a certificate is online. Importantly, this includes the option to spread the cost via direct debit over ten months for a twelve month certificate.\r\n \r\nAlthough extensive arrangements are in place to ensure people can access affordable prescriptions, we recognise that more could be done to promote them. The NHS Business Services Authority (NHS BSA) has already taken forward a project to promote PPCs among patients and is now proactively working with specific pharmacy chains to raise awareness. It has also worked with the Citizens Advice Bureau to encourage them to talk to clients about PPCs if appropriate. PPCs are publicised on the NHS BSA’s website and on NHS Choices and in 2016-17 the NHS BSA sent out over 1.6 million posters and leaflets to promote the scheme in GP surgeries and pharmacies.\r\n\r\nThe NHS BSA is exploring ways to help patients navigate the “help with health costs” landscape better so that they can get appropriate help with their health costs.  It is looking at the whole customer journey to identify areas where the process can be simplified and improved. This includes a move, where appropriate, to digitisation of the service. We are considering whether more can be done to support healthcare professionals with alerting patients to the help that might be available to them.\r\n\r\nThe NHS BSA has already developed an online tool to help patients to find out what help they may be able to get and where to apply for it. There have been over seventy five thousand users since it launched in September 2017 and the NHS BSA has received positive feedback on it. This checker has more recently been promoted on social media and has received national press coverage. \r\n\t\r\nThe current financial situation prevents the Government from making any significant changes to the prescription charging system. We will, however, ensure that the NHS BSA’s important work, publicising the extensive arrangements that are already in place continues.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care","created_at":"2018-04-26T11:09:07.046Z","updated_at":"2018-04-26T11:09:07.046Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":217239,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/217239.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Fund free BSL lessons for every parent or carer of a Deaf child in the UK","background":"90% of Deaf children are born to hearing families, most of which will have no experience of what they need to do to support that child.

We want to develop a new partnership with the EU that builds on our existing security relationship.","details":"We have always said that Parliament must be fully involved in shaping our exit from the EU. The Government has committed to hold a vote on the final deal in Parliament as soon as possible after the negotiations have concluded. This vote will cover both the Withdrawal Agreement and the terms for our future relationship. If Parliament supports the resolution to proceed with the Withdrawal Agreement and the terms for our future relationship, the Government will bring forward a Withdrawal Agreement \u0026 Implementation Bill to give the Withdrawal Agreement domestic legal effect.\r\n\r\nWhere it is necessary to implement future agreements the Government will introduce further legislation where it is needed, ensuring further opportunities for proper parliamentary scrutiny. \r\n\r\nWith regards to our future security partnership with the EU, in Munich, the Prime Minister set out the UK’s unconditional commitment to European security. It has always been the case that our security at home is best advanced through global cooperation, working with institutions that support that, including the EU. We want to develop a new partnership with the EU that builds on the depth and breadth of our existing security relationship; from foreign and defence policy, to law enforcement and criminal judicial cooperation.\r\n\r\nOur success will also depend on a breadth of partnerships that extend beyond cooperation with the EU. We must develop more bilateral cooperation between European nations, build the ad-hoc groupings that allow us to counter terrorism and hostile state threats, and we must ensure a reformed, modernised NATO remains the cornerstone of our shared security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlongside this, the UK remains committed to using its assets, capabilities and influence alongside the EU and our European partners. Our cooperation in this regard is not just vital because our people face common threats, but also because we share a deep, historic belief in the same values - the values of peace, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.\r\n\r\nThe UK therefore seeks to develop a deep and special partnership with the EU that goes beyond existing third country arrangements, and which builds on the breadth and depth of our shared interests and values. This must be a partnership that underpins practical collaboration to tackle real world challenges.\r\n\r\nAs part of this cooperation, where it is in the mutual interest, the UK would be ready to participate in EU missions and operations. However, we would require a level of involvement in the development and planning of such missions and operations, commensurate with the scale of deployment and the operational risk attached. \r\n\r\nIn other areas, a more informal relationship could work for both parties. For instance, we will no longer be party to Common Foreign and Security Policy, and will pursue an independent foreign policy. But we should maintain regular close consultations on foreign and security policy issues, and align where it is in our mutual interest. An informal, political relationship would enable cooperation but retain the autonomy of both the UK and the EU.\r\n\r\nWe intend, therefore, to approach negotiations with flexibility and practical benefit in mind.

As the national governing body for football in England, the FA is responsible for regulating, promoting and developing the game at every level.\r\n\r\nThe Sports Governance Code that came into force on 1 April 2017 applies to all sporting bodies in receipt of public funding from Sport England and UK Sport. It challenges the FA and all other governing bodies to demonstrate that they meet the highest standards of governance and regulation. The Code requires evidence that sports bodies operate efficiently and successfully while being transparent and representative of society.\r\n\r\nWe therefore welcome the reforms the FA has made to comply with the Code that include reducing its Board in size from 12 to 10 members, ensuring a more even gender split, and ensuring at least a quarter of its members are independent of football club interests. We believe that moving to a thoroughly strategic, accountable and representative Board with the right mix of skills, diversity and experience is the key to unlocking the long-term potential of football in this country, from grassroots up to the national teams.\r\n\r\nThe reform of the FA Council; changes to tenure, and the addition of new members will help ensure this body is also more representative of the modern game. The principle that all FA Committees should report to the Board is one we strongly support and is a requirement under the Code.\r\n\r\nWe are comfortable that the actions the FA has already taken and further actions it has agreed to implement to comply with the Sports Governance Code will improve its governance. This will continue to be monitored and managed through funding conditions which require ongoing compliance with the Code.\r\n\r\nThe Premier League (PL) and the English Football League (EFL) are not in receipt of public funding and therefore they and the clubs in their leagues are not regulated through the mandatory condition of funding which requires compliance with the Sports Governance Code. However, the PL and the EFL have established their own regulatory frameworks which clubs are required to comply with in order to participate in their respective leagues.\r\n\r\nIndeed we welcome the fact that the financial state of football clubs in this country is better now than at any time over the last 20 years. Measures introduced in recent years include the Leagues requiring business cases and proof of funds from club owners, a working relationship between clubs and HMRC over tax owed, and the adoption of financial fair play rules. Together these have helped curb club debt and promoted sustainability. However, football clubs and the football authorities cannot be complacent. They must keep these rules under constant review.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, with regard to ownership of clubs, the onus for the football authorities is ensuring the criteria (known as the ‘Owners and Directors (ODT) Test’) as to whom can hold a controlling interest in clubs is as robust as possible, that due diligence is carried out on owners and conditions on what they can and cannot do are laid down from the start. We are pleased the football authorities have agreed to keep the ODT test under regular review and to listen to supporters’ concerns. This promise was outlined in the report of the Government’s Expert Working Group on Supporter Ownership and Engagement published in January 2016.\r\n\r\nWe are clear that we do not expect that the PL or EFL’s rulebooks will be superseded but it is right that policy-making on disciplinary issues sits outside the Leagues. The Football Regulatory Authority for example, is a body responsible for regulatory, disciplinary and rule-making for football played in England. The membership of the body is jointly made up of representatives from the national game, professional game and independent non-executives. \r\n\r\nThe Independent Football Ombudsman is also there to receive and adjudicate on complaints which have failed to be resolved by football clubs or the football authorities.  The IFO is an important part of football’s self-regulatory system.\r\n\r\nWe accept that football governance must keep evolving if it is to keep pace with the challenges of the modern game and the global commercial attractiveness of English football. The Sports Governance Code helps, but the FA and other football bodies responsible for regulation of the game should continue to review how they are set up to ensure the effective running of the sport. At present, the regulatory framework that operates via league regulation through the PL and the EFL demonstrates there is already regulation of the governance of all football clubs. Where regulation is being managed by the existing authorities in football to the extent which it is, this negates the desire or need to establish an independent regulator\r\n\r\nDepartment for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","created_at":"2018-03-29T13:44:30.259Z","updated_at":"2018-03-29T13:44:30.259Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":219020,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/219020.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Proscribe Hizballah in its entirety under the Terrorism Act 2000","background":"Supporters of Hizballah annually parade through London and are permitted to do so on the grounds that only Hizballah’s “military wing” is proscribed.

In response to the recent increases in knife crime, gun crime and homicide the Government published on 9 April the Serious Violence Strategy. ","details":"The Government is determined to break the deadly cycle of violence that devastates the lives of individuals, families and communities.  In response to the recent increases in knife crime, gun crime and homicide, the Government published the Serious Violence Strategy.  The Strategy outlines an ambitious programme working with a range of Government Departments and partnerships across a number of sectors such as education, health, social services, housing, youth services, and victim services.  \r\n\r\nThe strategy makes clear that our approach is not solely focused on law enforcement, very important as that is, but depends also on partnerships across a number of sectors.  In particular, it needs the support of communities thinking about what they can do themselves to help prevent violent crime happening in the first place and how they can support measures to get young people and young adults involved in positive activities.  \r\n\r\nWe know intervening early can help us catch young people before they go down the wrong path, encouraging them to make positive choices and that is why the strategy represents a step change in the way we think and respond and in particular, a shift to early intervention and prevention steering young people away from crime in the first place and put in place measures to tackle the root causes of the problem.\r\n \r\nAction in the strategy is centred on the following key themes:\r\n\r\n•\tTackling county lines and misuse of drugs; \r\n•\tEarly intervention and prevention;\r\n•\tSupporting communities and local partnerships; and\r\n•\tLaw enforcement and the criminal justice response\r\n\r\nThe strategy sets out a range of key actions we will take to tackle serious violence, building on the significant programmes of work already in place to tackle knife crime, gun crime and the acid attacks action plan.  The strategy includes over 60 specific commitments for action in the coming months and years ahead including creation of a new National County Lines Coordination Centre, creation of a new Early Intervention Youth Fund and measures to strengthen local partnerships and the multi-agency response to this issue. \r\n\r\nThe Home Secretary will be overseeing implementation of the strategy through a refocused Inter-Ministerial Group on the Serious Violence Strategy and through creation of a new Serious Violence Taskforce.  The Taskforce will include key representatives from national and local government, Police and Crime Commissioners and key delivery partners including representatives from health, education and industry.  \r\n\r\nWe will introduce an Offensive Weapons Bill to include a ban on the sale of the most dangerous corrosive products to under-18s, make it a criminal offence to possess corrosive substances in a public place and bring in tough restrictions on online sales of knives, as well as announcing plans to publicly consult on extending stop and search powers to enable the police to search for, and seize, acid from people carrying it in public without good reason.\r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2018-04-19T09:33:55.610Z","updated_at":"2018-04-19T09:33:55.610Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":214210,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/214210.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Accept a role as guarantor to the USS pension scheme","background":"The USS pension deficit is due to a \"self sufficiency in gilts\" valuation method that models what would happen if the pre-92 universities went bankrupt.

The Government has a statutory requirement to report annually to Parliament on its progress in delivering against the Covenant.","details":"The Armed Forces Covenant (“the Covenant”) is a promise by the nation that the Armed Forces community (serving personnel, veterans, and their families) should not be disadvantaged in accessing public and private goods and services as a result of their service and that special provision should be made for those who have sacrificed the most, including the injured and the bereaved.\r\n\r\nEnshrined in the 2011 Armed Forces Act, the Covenant applies across the UK. The Government (HMG) has a statutory requirement to report annually to Parliament on its progress in upholding the Covenant. These reports include a growing list of objective performance measures and the independent observations of the Service charities and the Families Federations to hold HMG to account.\r\n\r\nSince 2011 much has been achieved and more remains to be done.  The Covenant is embedded in the NHS constitution and awareness in healthcare professionals of issues faced by the Armed Forces community is improving -  the Covenant now forms part of the Royal College of GPs’ membership exam.  Access to specialist prosthetics treatments and to mental healthcare services has improved significantly, following the launch of the Transition, Intervention and Liaison Services, and Complex Treatment Service. In England, the Service Pupil Premium has provided funding to mitigate the impact of Service life on children’s education and from September, more detail will be available to teachers via the Common Transfer File on Service children’s educational needs and family circumstances.  Young Service families are being helped onto the property ladder with the Forces Help to Buy scheme which has awarded £215 million (circa £15,000 per claim) to around 14,300 successful applicants since April 2014.  While there is a great deal of support available, those who need it are not always aware of how to access it. The Covenant-funded Veterans Gateway looks to address this by providing a single point of contact and signposting veterans to the most appropriate source of support; to date 8,486 veterans have contacted the service.\r\n\r\nAll 407 Local Authorities (LAs) in GB have signed the Covenant, with bespoke arrangements in Northern Ireland. Guidance is available to LAs on how they can most effectively support their Service populations; including using the £10 million per annum Covenant Fund to build local partnerships between the Armed Forces and the wider community.\r\n  \r\nThe partnership theme is also resonating in the private sector where support for the Covenant is growing rapidly, with more than 2,500 signatories. Companies are pledging support to veterans, reservists and military spouses by offering flexible HR policies and acknowledging the skills learnt during time in the Services. Further success has been achieved commercially, with companies agreeing to waive cancellation fees on media packages for those posted at short notice and mortgage providers exempting Service personnel from higher rate buy-to-let mortgage products.\r\n\r\nWhen there is a need to legislate, then we will do so, for example the Armed Forces (Flexible Working) Act 2018 reflects the demands of modern family life by providing more flexible working opportunities, in acknowledgement of the desire of Service personnel to have more control over their careers and how they live. Another example is HMG’s new statutory requirement, due to come into effect this autumn, to refer Service leavers at risk of homelessness to the relevant LA. Targeting specific issues in this way is the most effective means of mitigating disadvantage.\r\n\r\nHMG’s commitment to the Covenant was reinforced in 2017 with the creation of the Ministerial Covenant and Veterans Board, strengthening delivery of the Covenant across government. Every Department on the Board has appointed a lead Minister for Covenant issues. The Board is also overseeing a veterans’ strategy which will review current provision for veterans across the UK and make its recommendations before the end of the year. As part of this work, the MOD is also developing a new transition policy to provide more comprehensive support to Service families as they transition to civilian life, including advice and support on housing matters.\r\n\r\nIt is HMG’s view that much of what the Covenant has achieved so far stems from its voluntary nature.  It is a pact between the Armed Forces community and the nation in acknowledgment of the sacrifices they have made.  The nation honours this pact because it is the right thing to do, not because they are obliged to do so.  \r\n\r\nUseful links:\r\nForces Help to Buy statistics\r\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/701878/FHTB_Official_Statistics_Q4_201718.pdf\r\nVeterans Gateway\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/veterans-gateway\r\n\r\nGuidance for local authorities\r\nhttps://www.armedforcescovenant.gov.uk/localauthorities/\r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence","created_at":"2018-05-31T12:39:19.662Z","updated_at":"2018-06-01T13:34:49.113Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":214478,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/214478.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Anyone convicted of involvement in dog-fighting to receive a custodial sentence.","background":"Although dog-fighting in the UK has been illegal for many years it continues due to the underground nature of those involved.

They are an important indicator of the great strides we have made in improving our waterways, with more than 5,300 miles of rivers being improved since 2010. There have been no reintroductions of otters by conservation groups since the late 1990s and the bulk of the recovery of the otter has been through natural re-colonisation.  \r\n\r\nA healthy otter population results from favourable conditions in the natural environment, including water quality and the availability of prey (including fish), as well as availability of breeding sites. Otters are found at low density, and limit their own populations through territorial activity. Carrying capacity is determined by environmental conditions.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence to suggest that otters have a major impact on wildlife as a whole, and although localised impacts could occur where otters have not been previously present for some time, they are a natural part of the freshwater ecosystem and we believe these systems will adapt to the return of the natural top predator.  \r\n\r\nWe do recognise that otters can in some instances impact on still water fisheries, which is why there is provision through the Angling Improvement Fund (AIF), administered by the Angling Trust on the Environment Agency’s behalf, to help deliver improvements including projects to protect fisheries from otter predation through the erection of otter-proof fencing. Further information can be found on the Angling Trust website at: www.anglingtrust.net.\r\n\r\nOtters are a protected species and it is an offence to harm capture, kill, disturb or injure any animal and/or damage, destroy or obstruct their resting or sheltering places. Therefore any methods of control, including non-lethal methods, would constitute an offence.

This Act sets out the process by which trans people can legally change their gender. We will publish this consultation in due course. All members of the public will be able to respond to the consultation. Once the consultation has closed and the Government has carefully considered the responses, only then will we decide how to reform the GRA. \r\n\r\nGender recognition is a devolved issue and the Scottish Government ran a separate consultation, which closed on 1 March 2018.\r\n \r\nWe have been clear since announcing our intention to consult on the GRA that we will ask about how we can make the process of applying for a Gender Recognition Certificate less bureaucratic and intrusive for trans people. That does not necessarily mean we are proposing self-declaration of gender. The Government will consider the results of the consultation carefully before making any decision on how to reform the GRA. We are clear that we have no intention of amending the Equality Act 2010, the legislation that allows for single sex spaces. Any GRA reform will not change the protected characteristics in the Equality Act nor the exceptions under the Equality Act that allow provision for single and separate sex spaces.\r\n\r\nThe Government does not intend to change the safeguarding processes that are currently used in refuges and healthcare services. Providers of women-only services can continue to provide services in a different way, or even not provide services to trans individuals, provided it is objectively justified on a case-by-case basis. The same can be said about toilets, changing rooms or single sex activities. Providers may exclude trans people from facilities of the sex they identify with, provided it is a proportionate means of meeting a legitimate aim. \r\n\r\nWe are committed to a respectful and evidence-based discussion, and, for this reason, we have engaged in many pre-consultation meetings with a range of stakeholders including women’s groups, charities and service providers. We will continue to do so during the consultation. The consultation offers an opportunity for women from all backgrounds to be heard.\r\n \r\nAs part of our evidence gathering, we are looking at the experiences of other countries who have different gender recognition models. There are countries, such as Ireland, Malta, and Belgium that have adopted a self-declaration model, making use of statutory declarations. We are also looking at countries that do not have a full self-declaration model, such as the Netherlands. \r\n\r\nWe want to emphasise that any reform of the GRA will not mean reform to the medical treatment that trans people receive, and the age at which they can receive this. Access to treatment on the NHS, including cross-sex hormones (which the NHS allows from 16) and surgery (which the NHS allows from 18), is not regulated by the GRA, but decided on by clinicians. Any GRA reform will not change this.\r\n\r\nWhen the GRA was introduced, it was considered a world-leading piece of legislation. Whilst it has worked well in many ways, over the last decade it has been viewed as outdated. We have heard from many trans people that the current requirements feel overly intrusive and bureaucratic. It includes the need to provide a diagnosis of gender dysphoria and a second medical report of any treatment, proof of having lived for at least two years in their acquired gender, the approval of their spouse if married, as well as the fee to apply, and any associated costs with obtaining supporting evidence. Furthermore, trans people are already able to more easily change their name and gender in their passport and driving license. Streamlining the process of changing their legal gender on their birth certificate, so that they are recognised legally in their acquired gender, would help trans people to have all their identity documents match. \r\n\r\nThe process of gaining a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC), as set out in the Gender Recognition Act, is a Government service that is not working well for the people it is designed for. Only 4,850 GRCs have been issued since the Act came into force. Our research shows that trans people find the process too bureaucratic and hard to use. We therefore propose improving this service, but want to ensure we only do so after a full consultation, to allow us to hear from trans people, and also from women’s groups, faith groups, LGBT groups, young people’s organisations, charities, refuges, and many more individuals and organisations, so that we can decide how best to make these reforms.\r\n\r\nThe Government is committed to improving the position of women and girls, and supports their rights, safety, privacy and dignity. We are also committed to improving the position of trans people and supporting their rights. We are confident that advancing the rights of trans people does not have to compromise women’s rights, and will work with all groups to ensure this.\r\n\r\nGovernment Equalities Office","created_at":"2018-06-05T09:27:51.923Z","updated_at":"2018-06-05T09:27:51.923Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":209458,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/209458.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Theresa May: Cancel the invitation for Saudi Crown Prince to visit the UK","background":"We call on the Prime Minister to withdraw the invitation for the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to visit the UK.

","details":"The longstanding partnership between Saudi Arabia and the UK has helped make both of our countries safer and more prosperous. \r\n\r\nWe have vital national security and economic interests in maintaining and developing our strong relationship, including how we can work together to tackle international challenges such as terrorism and extremism. As the Prime Minister said when she attended the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) in 2016 “intelligence we have received in the past from Saudi Arabia has saved potentially hundreds of lives in the UK.”\r\n\r\nEngagement with Saudi Arabia provides an opportunity to further develop our relationship, building the trust and respect necessary to enhance our engagement on all areas of mutual concern. Visits in both directions are an important opportunity for us to have constructive discussions about the full range of issues that are of mutual concern. \r\n\r\nThe Crown Prince has embarked on a series of reforms to modernise society and the economy within Saudi Arabia. The country is changing rapidly, with steps such as allowing women to drive and attend football matches, reopening cinemas and a commitment that women will make up one third of the Saudi workforce by 2030. The Crown Prince has also set out his commitment to return Saudi Arabia to a moderate Islam that is open to all religions.\r\n\r\nThis greater inclusivity is vital for the future of Saudi Arabia and the UK will support Saudi Arabia as it embarks on this era of change. The Crown Prince’s agenda will bring new opportunities for us to work together for the long-term benefit, stability and success of both our countries. \r\nWe welcome the recent positive developments, but we also recognise that there are further steps to take. \r\nOur starting point for engagement on human rights with all countries is based on what is practical, realistic and achievable, and we will always be ready to speak out as a matter of principle. We raise our concerns with the Saudi Arabian authorities using a range of Ministerial and diplomatic channels of communication, including our Ambassador, the Embassy team and the European Union in Riyadh. So whilst there are areas where we will continue to have different views to Saudi Arabia – including human rights - our relationship enables us to speak frankly, openly and constructively about these issues.\r\n\r\nOn Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, along with other GCC member states, provided support to the Government of Bahrain in 2011 as part of the Peninsula Shield agreement. At the request of the Government of Bahrain, GCC security personnel were deployed to Bahrain to ensure vital infrastructure was secure. The UK monitors events in Bahrain closely and where we have concerns we raise these at senior levels. \r\n\r\nThe UK is committed to securing a political solution that ends the humanitarian disaster in Yemen, and supports the UN Special Envoy to Yemen in facilitating a credible peace process. The UK will continue to play a leading role in supporting the UN to find a peaceful solution to the conflict, including through close engagement with our regional and international partners. Inward visits provide further opportunities for the UK to discuss solutions to the crisis. \r\n\r\nThe UK supports the Saudi-led Coalition military intervention, which came at the request of the internationally-recognised Yemeni President Hadi, to deter aggression by the Houthis, and allow for the return of the legitimate Yemeni Government.  The Houthis have consistently failed to adhere to UN Security Council Resolutions, including by launching attacks against Saudi Arabia and shipping in the Bab al-Mandab strait.\r\n\r\nWe regularly raise the importance of compliance with International Humanitarian Law (IHL) with the Saudi Arabian Government and other members of the military Coalition. Saudi Arabia has publicly stated that it is investigating reports of alleged violations of IHL, and that lessons will be acted upon.  We continue to monitor the situation closely.\r\n\r\nThe UK government takes its defence export responsibilities very seriously and operates one of the most robust export control regimes in the world. We rigorously examine every application on a case-by-case basis against the Consolidated EU and National arms export licensing Criteria and continue to keep our defence exports under careful review to ensure they meet these standards. A judicial review into decisions regarding exports to Saudi Arabia for possible use in the conflict in Yemen found in favour of the government’s position.\r\n\r\nForeign and Commonwealth Office","created_at":"2018-02-26T16:59:30.544Z","updated_at":"2018-02-26T16:59:30.544Z"},"debate":null}}]}
