It seems that achieving a Grade D in math at GCSE portrays the idea that we cannot do math. This is absolutely absurd, just because people did not achieve a grade C or above does not mean we cannot do the basic math. I simply believe, to become a teacher within the UK, math should only be a requirement depending on the type of Course the individual would like to teach.","state":"open","signature_count":9,"created_at":"2018-03-22T19:07:42.148Z","updated_at":"2018-04-15T07:53:45.542Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-03-28T09:29:46.854Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-03-22T20:39:27.501Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Kieran Millard","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":215644,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/215644.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Allow fast food delivery drivers access to bus lanes during operating hours.","background":"As the majority of bus lanes restrict public traffic from travelling along them between 7am-7pm, a lot of fast food takeaways deliver within these hours and delivery drivers are commonly stuck in traffic during rush hour.
