The outcome of this is that medication is seen as the only credible resort when treating patients suffering from psychotic illness. When patients suffer side effects they are seen as non-compliant and when they stop medication they are placed on CTOs. This violates the patient's autonomy to make decisions for themselves about their treatment.","state":"open","signature_count":17,"created_at":"2018-02-27T20:51:52.229Z","updated_at":"2018-08-10T09:40:01.512Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-04-25T10:24:23.470Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-03-01T19:18:38.293Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Lakshmi Premchand","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":230205,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/230205.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Stop Myxomatosis killing wild Rabbits by developing a lifetime vaccine","background":"Myxomatosis is cruel disease which millions of wild rabbits in the UK die from each year.
