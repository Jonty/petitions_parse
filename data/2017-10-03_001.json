There will be no further concessions on this issue to avoid placing an unfair burden on working age people. ","details":"State Pension age (SPa) changes\r\nThe Government took necessary action in response to rapid rises in longevity by increasing men and women’s SPa in the Pensions Act 2011. This accelerated the equalisation of women’s SPa by 18 months and brought forward the increase in men and women’s SPa to 66 by five and a half years, relative to the previous timetables. Failing to act in light of compelling demographic evidence would have been irresponsible and would have placed an unfair fiscal burden on the working population.\r\n\r\nThe Government has done a huge amount to improve pensions for all, particularly women. Future women pensioners stand to benefit on average from a higher new State Pension payment, from the expansion of Automatic Enrolment, and our Fuller Working Lives strategy. And a woman retiring today can still expect to receive the State Pension for over 24.5 years on average – three years longer than men. If State Pension ages had not been equalised, women would be expected to spend over 40% of their adult life in retirement.\r\n\r\nThe Government has taken this issue very seriously and has looked at a range of alternative options, including options considered by Parliament during the passage of the 2011 Act. This resulted in a £1.1bn concession, which capped the increase in SPa at 18 months relative to the 1995 timetable, and benefited almost a quarter of a million women who would otherwise have experienced delays of up to two years.\r\n\r\nAll alternative options offered by stakeholders to mitigate the impact on those affected come at significant cost to the public purse. Reversing the Pensions Act 2011 would cost over £30bn, whilst returning to a female SPa of 60 would cost in excess of £70bn by 2020/21 alone (with £38bn needing to be found in this tax year alone), and would generate a new cliff-edge and inequality between women and men.\r\n\r\nIntroducing further concessions cannot be justified given the imperative to focus public resources on helping those most in need.\r\n\r\nHelping people work for longer\r\nThe Government is committed to supporting people aged 50 years and over to remain in and return to work. The number of older women in work is now at a record high: there are around 1 million more women aged 50+ in work than in 2010. The average age of exit from the labour market for women is currently 63.6 – well above the previous women’s SPa of 60.\r\n\r\nGovernment has reformed legislation to create the right framework to support Fuller Working Lives. We have removed the Default Retirement Age, meaning it is now unlawful to dismiss someone just because they reach age 65. We have also extended the right to request flexible working to all employees with six months continuous service, so that people can negotiate a work pattern that suits their circumstances.\r\n\r\nOur ‘Fuller Working Lives Strategy: A Partnership Approach’, published in February 2017, aims to increase the retention, retraining and recruitment of older workers, and bring about a change in the perceptions and attitudes of employers.\r\nWe have also appointed a Business Champion for Older Workers, Andy Briggs, supported by a team of employers at Business In The Community, to spearhead Government’s work and actively promote the benefits of older workers to employers across England – influencing them both strategically and in terms of practical advice.\r\n\r\nThe Government is also committed to supporting the vulnerable and spends around £50 billion a year on benefits to support disabled people and people with health conditions alone. Whilst Carers Allowance and related benefits provide financial support and safeguards for carers and their families, including those who are ill or have disabilities.\r\n\r\nCommunication of SPa changes\r\nSince 1995 the Government has gone to significant lengths to communicate SPa changes, including high-profile campaigns and writing directly to those affected.\r\nSignificantly, in the last 17 years the Department has provided over 18 million personalised State Pension estimates to people who requested them (either online or by telephone or post; and based on old and new State Pension rules). The Department has encouraged people to request these as part of their long-term financial planning – after all, retirement is a life changing financial decision and there is an expectation that people will plan for this.\r\n\r\nThere is no legal obligation to write to people to tell them about changes in their SPa. In the years after the 1995 legislation (1995 to 2011) this equalisation was frequently reported in the media and debated at length in parliament. People were notified with leaflets, an extensive advertising campaign was carried out, and later individual letters were posted out. The changes in the 2011 Act occurred following a public Call for Evidence and extensive debates in Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn summary\r\nIncreasing life expectancy is a cause for celebration but it also presents significant fiscal pressures as relatively fewer working age people are called upon to support a growing number of pensioners. The old age dependency ratio is set to increase by one quarter over the next 25 years – from 301 pensioners for every 1,000 working age people today, to 375 pensioners for every 1,000 working age people by 2042.\r\nWith the increasing financial pressures described, we cannot unpick a policy that has been in place for 22 years. It is simply not affordable, especially when we take into account that the average woman reaching State Pension age last year will get a higher state pension income over her lifetime than an average woman reaching SPa at any point before.\r\n\r\nThere will be no further concessions on this issue as this would require people of working age, and more specifically younger people, to bear an even greater share of the cost of the pensions system. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions","created_at":"2017-09-27T13:23:08.770Z","updated_at":"2017-09-27T13:23:08.770Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":200165,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200165.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Leave the EU immediately","background":"The Government should walk away from the Article 50 negotiations and leave the EU immediately with no deal.

Evidence for the effectiveness of screening women under 50 is limited.","details":"Breast cancer can be a devastating disease which is why the Government is committed to providing well-managed screening programmes that are based on the most current peer reviewed evidence to ensure the greatest benefit.\r\n\r\nA screening programme is introduced following a robust process using peer reviewed evidence that shows the benefits to screen clearly outweigh harm and they are subject to central programme specifications and quality assurance. The English cancer screening programmes are internationally renowned for their rigour, standard of evidence, national implementation and quality assurance.\r\n\r\nThe NHS Breast Screening Programme (NHS BSP) in England offers all women between the ages of 50 and 70 the opportunity to be screened every three years for breast cancer, in order to help detect abnormalities and reduce the number of lives lost to invasive breast cancer.  The aim of the NHS BSP is to detect breast cancer early when there is a greater chance of cure, thus reducing the number of lives lost to invasive breast cancer.  \r\n\r\nThe programme recognises that whilst early detection is the best way to reduce breast cancer mortality by giving the opportunity to offer women more treatment options, which may save lives, it accepts that there are also risks. These risks include over-diagnosis (referring women for unnecessary tests) and over-treatment (operating on women with disease which is unlikely to cause serious harm to them).  For women under the age of 50, breast screening is not very effective, especially when they have not reached the menopause.  Breast screening is offered from  the age of 50 based on the average age of menopause being 51 and that the chance of developing breast cancer increases with age.  Four out of five breast cancers develop in women over the age of 50. There is insufficient evidence to confidently offer breast screening to women at a much younger age because to do so may cause more harm than good.  Not all breast cancers can be detected early when they are non-invasive and some women with non-invasive disease would never have cancer during their lifetime. \r\n\r\nThere are several trials in the Programme addressing these issues currently:\r\n•\tForget me not www.sloaneproject.co.uk/NonTreatmentStudy.htm  \r\n•\tLoris www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/find-a-clinical-trial/a-trial-comparing-surgery-with-active-monitoring-for-low-risk-dcis-loris\r\n•\t Sloane www.sloaneproject.co.uk/. \r\n \r\nThe 2012 UK independent review of breast cancer screening (Marmot review) estimated that inviting women between the ages of 50-70 reduces mortality from breast cancer in the population invited by 20% and saves an estimated 1,300 lives a year.  It also found that screening women outside the ages of 50 to 70 years could lead to over-diagnosis or over-treatment. To read the review, please visit: http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/prod_consump/groups/cr_common/@nre/@pol/documents/generalcontent/breast-screening-report.pdf \r\n\r\nIn June 2015, the World Health Organisation’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) published the findings of a review on breast cancer screening in the New England Journal of Medicine. A group of 29 independent international experts from 16 countries, convened by the IARC, assessed the cancer-preventive and adverse effects of various methods of screening for breast cancer. The findings of the review support the current age at which women are first invited for breast screening in England and the three year interval period between invitations. The IARC’s review found that the evidence for the effectiveness of screening women in the younger age group of 40 to 49 was limited. Women aged over 70 are not routinely invited for breast screening because there is no evidence to support this, although they are entitled to self-refer every three years if they wish. You review can be accessed here: www.iarc.fr/en/mediacentre/pr/2015/pdfs/pr234_E.pdf\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the age extension trial began to investigate into whether extending screening to 47-49 and 71-73 year olds is clinically and cost effective. This trial is led by researchers at the University of Oxford and will provide robust evidence about the effectiveness of screening in these age groups, which will include the benefit and harms. The trial is expected to report in 2020. \r\n\r\nWomen that are identified as being at high risk of the disease (e.g. due to a genetic mutation such as BRCA1/2 or having had supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy at a young age) can be referred into the programme at a younger age. However, for this younger cohort, screening is usually performed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which is a more suitable screening test than mammography alone.\r\n \r\nWe encourage all women to be breast aware and anyone with concerns should discuss these with their General Practitioner. \r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2017-09-26T14:00:15.161Z","updated_at":"2017-09-26T14:00:15.161Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":200000,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200000.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make British Sign Language part of the National Curriculum","background":"Around 50,000 people in the UK use British Sign Language, so why is this not taught in schools?
