Our reforms to the special educational needs and disabilities system emphasise providing tailored support to meet pupils’ specific needs. The reforms encourage close working with parents and pupils to make sure the support that pupils need is identified early. We work with, and provide funding to, dyslexia organisations to help to ensure that these pupils get the necessary support. \r\n\r\nIt is essential that all pupils leave primary school with the skills to succeed in secondary school. Pupils who can spell quickly and precisely are able to write down their ideas fluently and accurately, freeing them to concentrate on the meaning of what they want to say. Spelling is therefore a vital element of the National Curriculum at both key stages and is included as part of the teacher assessments of writing in Year 2 and Year 6. \r\n\r\nThe new interim teacher assessment framework for Key Stage 2 (KS2) is designed to assess the extent to which pupils have gained a secure grounding in the National Curriculum before they move on to the next stage of their education. This will be assessed by the pupils’ teachers. In writing, to meet the ‘expected standard’ pupils must be able to spell most words accurately, using the detailed spelling rules and guidance in the KS2 programme of study. The statutory KS2 wordlists are made up of words that we know pupils frequently misspell. \r\n\r\nThese assessments form part of the information used to help teachers and parents understand how pupils are performing against national expectations. They also allow us to hold schools to account for how well they have supported all their pupils to reach the expected standard.\r\n\r\nAssessment by pupils’ teachers at the end of Year 6 provides the secondary schools with accurate information on their new Year 7 pupils. The secondary schools can then effectively support all the pupils who did not meet the expected standard to achieve their full potential. They cannot respond quickly to these pupils’ needs if the assessment information they receive does not reflect accurately what pupils know and can do.\r\n\r\nOur approach applies to all pupils, including those with dyslexia, because it is in these pupils’ best interests that teachers assess accurately what they can or cannot do. \r\n\r\nStatutory assessments, however, form only part of the broader assessments that teachers continually make. Schools should report statutory assessment outcomes in the context of wider information about pupils’ overall achievements and progress across the whole curriculum.    \r\n\r\nDepartment for Education","created_at":"2016-05-04T13:58:31.211Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T13:58:31.211Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":131481,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/131481.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Ban the wearing of a Burka, any full or partial front face coverings in public.","background":"All full or partial front face coverings should be banned in public for security reasons, the Burka its self is a huge security risk, the person wearing it could be male or female unless you can see the full face you would never know.

It should be noted that a cervical screening test (previously known as a smear test) is a method of detecting abnormal cells on the cervix and is unlikely to be appropriate when a woman has gynaecological issues that are symptomatic of cancer. The guidelines recommend that GPs should consider a suspected cancer pathway referral (for an appointment within 2 weeks) for women if, on examination, the appearance of their cervix is consistent with cervical cancer and do not include the need to conduct a cervical screening test.

The latter provides for public service pensions to be uprated at the same time and by the same percentage as the increase in the additional pension provided under the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (SERPS), which has been based on the increase in the CPI since April 2011. Prior to this date the RPI was used rather than the CPI. The underlying purpose of this legislation is to maintain the purchasing power of the additional elements of state retirement pensions and public service pensions. \r\n\r\nThe rationale for the change is as follows:\r\n•\tCPI is the headline measure of inflation used by the Bank of England;\r\n•\tCPI takes better account of how behaviour changes in response to price changes; \r\n•\tCPI also more accurately represents the inflation experience of pensioners and benefit recipients – for example, RPI excludes pensioners who receive a significant proportion of their income from the State (up to 20% of retired households); and\r\n•\tCPI is less volatile – for example, RPI was negative in September 2009 whereas CPI continued to rise.\r\n\r\nThe pension is accrued (or activated) on the basis of current prices.  The uprating of pensions does not apply retrospectively.\r\n\r\nIn response to a legal challenge against this decision the High Court and the Court of Appeal both ruled in the Government's favour, finding that CPI is appropriate for benefits and pensions uprating.\r\n\r\nRPI has also historically experienced periods of negative year on year change, as in 2009 when the uprating of pensions in payment was also frozen.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence","created_at":"2016-05-27T14:26:17.605Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T14:28:05.184Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":128795,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/128795.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Amend the immigration bill to allow 3000 lone child refugees to enter the UK","background":"On Monday 25th April 2016, MPs voted AGAINST amending the bill to allow these stranded children refuge in the UK.

We are looking to transfer children who were already registered in Europe before the EU-Turkey deal came into force on 20 March, where it is in their best interests.\r\n\r\nWe must put the best interests of children first, and avoid any policy that places children at additional risk or encourages them to place their lives in the hands of the people traffickers and criminal gangs.  In any response, we need to be very careful not to inadvertently create a situation in which families see an advantage in sending children ahead, putting their lives at risk by attempting perilous sea crossings to Europe.\r\n\r\nWe will work closely with local authorities. We must ensure we fulfil our obligations to children who are already in UK, as well ensuring we have the right support for those who may be brought to the UK from Europe.\r\n\r\nWe will consult relevant NGOs, UNHCR, UNICEF and Member States on how best we implement this legislation.  The very nature of this amendment means we must take the time to consult others before bringing final proposals on how to implement.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, the UK continues to take a comprehensive approach to the Syria conflict and migration crisis by providing significant aid and assistance; including our resettlement programmes.  On 4 February 2016, the Prime Minister announced that the UK will more than double our total pledge to the Syria crisis from £1.12 billion to over £2.3 billion.  This is our largest ever response to a single humanitarian crisis.  The Syrian Resettlement Scheme has already provided safe haven to more than 1000 vulnerable Syrians – around half of them children - and overall we expect children to make up a significant proportion of the 20,000 resettlement places we are providing to this group.\r\n\r\nAs announced on 21 April, we have worked closely with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to design a resettlement scheme that will protect the most vulnerable children. The new scheme has been designed with the UNHCR to resettle ‘children at risk’ from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.  The Government has committed to resettling several hundred individuals in the first year with a view to resettling up to 3000 individuals over the lifetime of this Parliament, the majority of which will be children, where the UNHCR deem it to be in their best interests. Children who are identified as at risk will be resettled with their family members or carers where appropriate.  There will be a review of the scheme at the two year mark.\r\n\r\nThis unique initiative will be the largest resettlement effort that focuses on children at risk from the MENA region.  The new scheme will be in addition to the Prime Minister’s commitment to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees. It is also in addition to our other existing resettlement schemes. \r\n\r\nIn regards to Europe, we are providing significant assistance to Member States facing particular pressures to ensure that all refugees can have effective access to protection, wherever they are.   The UK is the largest bilateral contributor to the humanitarian response to the crisis in Europe and the Balkans with a total contribution of £65m.  This includes nearly £46 million to provide life-saving aid to migrants and refugees including food, water, hygiene kits and infant packs, and protection for the most vulnerable, as well as support to organisations helping governments build their capacity to manage arrivals in Greece and the Balkans. The efforts of the partners we fund are targeted to reach the most vulnerable - including children.\r\n\r\nIt also includes the £10m Refugee Children Fund the Department for International Development (DFID) has created to support the needs of vulnerable refugee and migrant children specifically in Europe.

Two other health economies are also participating: Mid and South Essex and West, North and East Cumbria.\r\n\r\nThe regime is tailored to local circumstances, building on existing interventions and working with providers, commissioners and other local stakeholders to diagnose underlying issues and develop and implement the solutions to address both short-term performance and long-term strategic issues.\r\n\r\nFollowing an intense diagnostic phase, the North, East and West Devon Success Regime have published a “Case for Change” report, which sets out the underlying challenges facing the area and opportunities to reduce health inequalities, improve access to services and ensure clinical and financial stability. The Success Regime is now starting work locally to respond to the Case for Change. Potential service models for acute and community care are being considered. \r\n\r\nLocal and national leaders working as part of the Success Regime are conscious of the need to ensure that the people of North Devon are able to access high quality, sustainable services.

However, ear marking particular services could hinder a full process of options development which is necessary to reach the most sustainable proposals.\r\n\r\nNo decisions have yet been made and the input of local communities will remain important throughout the process.

The IPSPC recommended that the Normal Pension Age (NPA) for the new schemes be increased in line with the State Pension Age (SPA) to reflect increased life expectancy, which has grown dramatically in the last few decades. It was also recommended that the link between SPA and NPA should be reviewed regularly with a preference for keeping the two pension ages linked. This would more fairly distribute the benefits between scheme members. An exception was made for the uniformed services where the new NPA was set to age 60, rather than the national age of 65, to reflect the unique characteristics of the work involved. \r\n\r\nFor members of Armed Forces Pension Scheme 2015 (AFPS15) personnel who do not serve until the NPA of 60, an Early Departure Payment (EDP) consisting of a tax-free lump sum and an annual income is provided to personnel; provided they have completed 20 years’ service and reached age 40.  A similar arrangement exists for AFPS 05 members in that they must be aged at least 40 and serve for 18 years. These payments are designed to compensate personnel for the fact that a full military career is not available to the majority of Regular Service personnel, and the corresponding reduction in pension. It should be taken into account that, even prior to the change in NPA, only 2% of Service personnel served through to age 55. For AFPS75 members they are eligible to receive an immediate pension, subject to meeting the pension scheme’s criteria but are not eligible to receive EDP payments. \r\n\r\nService personnel who transferred across to the new Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS 15) had the value of the pension benefits earned up to the introduction of the new scheme protected. These benefits remain payable at the time they were expected to be paid in accordance with the legacy pension scheme rules and linked to the final pensionable salary at the point of leaving the Services. For those who transferred to the new pension scheme, the qualification period for the new EDP also includes time spent in a legacy scheme.  For those members who were within 10 years of their normal pension age as at 1 Apr 2012 they will remain in their existing schemes and be bound by those terms and conditions.   \r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that pensions can be taken from age 55 under AFPS 15, but these are actuarially reduced to reflect the fact that the pension will be paid over a longer period.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence","created_at":"2016-05-25T10:36:54.733Z","updated_at":"2016-05-25T10:36:54.733Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":126346,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/126346.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Legalise cannabis use for adults over 21 years of age..","background":"6 plants/18 seedlings/24 oz useable cannabis per adult.Allow extracts,medibles,topicals to be sold in licensed dispensaries,after being tested in accredited testing facilities.No restrictions of THC content.End prohibition and the failed war on drugs.We're not going away.","additional_details":"Psychotic illness is genetic in nature,not caused by cannabis,as per University of Toronto/Harvard Medical School and is,in fact,treated successfully with cannabis.Cannabis is used as an exit drug to treat alcoholism.Hebrew University in Jerusalem.Raphael Mechoulam, Ph.D of Hebrew University.Colorado,Washington,Oregon,Alaska, Washington DC,et al.The Lancet.JAMA.

","details":"The evidence from the Government’s independent experts, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, is that the use of cannabis is a “significant public health issue and can unquestionably cause harm to individuals and society”.  Legalising it would not prevent the crime associated with its production and supply, nor prevent the associated harms to users, their families and wider society. \r\n\r\nLegalisation would wrongly signal that cannabis use is without risk, particularly among those who do not use drugs. It is vital that we prevent people, especially young people, from using drugs in the first place and intervene early with those who do start to develop problems. Making cannabis legal would be counter-productive to this action.\r\n\r\nIndeed legalisation would carry its own administrative and enforcement costs which could be substantial. A system of this kind would continue to require resources from health services, enforcement partners and the criminal justice system to manage wider prescription and dependence treatment costs – including treating health harms of individual users; compliance activity and monitoring activities around production, demand and supply.\r\n\r\nWhere claims are made for medicinal applications, there is a clear regime in place, administered by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The regime enables medicines (including those containing controlled drugs) to be developed, licensed and made available for medicinal use to patients in the UK. For example, the cannabis-based medicine ‘Sativex’ has been granted marketing authorisation in the UK by the MHRA for the treatment of spasticity due to multiple sclerosis. Sativex was rigorously tested for its safety and efficacy before receiving approval. \r\n\r\nThe MHRA is open to considering marketing approval applications for other medicinal cannabis products should a product be developed.

This tragic incident further highlights the dangers of making perilous journeys across the Channel.\r\n\r\nThe Government continues to work with key EU Member States, including France, to ensure the Dublin Regulation family reunification process works effectively. Under the UK-France Joint Declaration, the UK and France have committed to ensuring that the provisions of the Dublin III Regulation are used efficiently and effectively.  To assist the handling of such cases, the two Governments have established a permanent official contact group, agreed single points of contact within respective Dublin Units and a UK asylum expert was seconded to the French administration to facilitate the improvement of all stages of the process.  The UK and France are running regular joint communication campaigns in northern France which inform unaccompanied children and others of their right to claim asylum in France. \r\n\r\nBetween the start of January 2016 and 2 July 2016, our records indicate that the UK has accepted over 50 requests from France under the Dublin Regulation to take charge of asylum seeking children on family grounds of which more than 40 have already been transferred to the UK.

Over 20 children who meet the criteria in the Immigration Act have been accepted for transfer to the UK since Royal Assent in May, the majority of whom have already arrived in the UK. As is required by the Immigration Act 2016, we are consulting with local authorities to confirm available capacity and to ensure appropriate support systems are in place. We are in active discussions with the UNHCR, UNICEF, NGOs and the Italian, Greek and French governments to strengthen and speed up mechanisms to identify, assess and transfer children who meet the criteria to the UK where this in their best interests.\r\n\r\nWe have always been clear that we want to support family reunification as much as possible. It is important to use the tools available to help children reunite with family wherever possible. We will prioritise cases with family links to the UK and where possible work within existing frameworks to ensure swift action is taken to assist these children.\r\n\r\nWe must put the best interests of children first, and avoid any policy that places children at additional risk or encourages them to place their lives in the hands of the people traffickers and criminal gangs.  In any response, we need to be very careful not to inadvertently create a situation in which families see an advantage in sending children ahead, putting their lives at risk by attempting perilous sea crossings to Europe.\r\n\r\nIn terms of support to Europe, we are providing significant assistance to Member States facing particular pressures to ensure that all refugees can have effective access to protection, wherever they are. The UK is the largest bilateral humanitarian contributor to the ongoing situation in Europe and the Balkans with a total contribution of £65 million.
