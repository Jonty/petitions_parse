The best way of avoiding it is for MPs to approve the deal. However, in the event of a no deal, the EU (Withdrawal) Act will be in place to ensure legal continuity.","details":"The EU (Withdrawal) Act is a vital piece of legislation ensuring that the UK has a functioning statute book once we have left the EU. It does not dictate the date and time at which we leave the EU. The default date and time of our departure was set when the UK notified the EU of its intention to withdraw under Article 50, which is a matter of international law. \r\n\r\nIf we were to repeal the EU (Withdrawal) Act ahead of our exit from the EU, it would not prevent the UK from leaving the EU, but instead lead to a huge amount of legal uncertainty. The European Communities Act would not be repealed despite the UK having left the EU, and many of the EU laws that businesses and citizens currently live under would not be transferred into our domestic law.\r\n\r\nThe decision to notify our withdrawal under Article 50 was authorised by Parliament through the EU (Notification of Withdrawal) Act, which was approved at Commons Second Reading with a large majority in favour in February 2017. That was, in turn, a response to the 2016 referendum result, in which the British people voted to leave the EU in one of the biggest democratic exercises in the country’s history. \r\n\r\nThe Government’s top priority remains securing Parliamentary approval for the deal we have negotiated with our European partners. That is the best way to deliver on the democratic choice of the British people and the best way to avoid no deal. In this settlement, the UK and the EU have agreed the terms for the UK’s smooth and orderly exit from the EU in the form of the Withdrawal Agreement, and a detailed political declaration on the terms of our future relationship. The Withdrawal Agreement offers a time-limited implementation period that provides a bridge to the future relationship, allowing businesses to continue trading as now until the end of 2020. \r\n\r\nUntil MPs have voted to approve the deal and the Withdrawal Agreement, we will do the responsible thing and prepare for every eventuality, including no deal. The Government has been preparing extensively for a no deal scenario for over two years to ensure that the country operates as smoothly as possible from the day we leave.\r\n\r\nWe have put in place numerous measures to mitigate the potential impact of no deal. For example, we have ensured that critical legislation is in place to ensure legal continuity, agreed key international agreements such as the Nuclear Cooperation deal with the US, Australia and Canada, and we are recruiting hundreds of Border Force officers to keep our border secure.\r\n\r\nWe have also taken steps to communicate to the public how Brexit will affect them and the practical steps that they can take to prepare for it. For example, in the summer of 2018 we published 106 specific technical notices to help businesses, citizens and consumers prepare for March 2019 in the event of a no-deal scenario. More recently, we launched a public information campaign at gov.uk/euexit to give UK citizens, businesses, EU citizens living in the UK and UK nationals living in the EU the latest advice and information on any aspect of Brexit. The Government will continue to provide advice to businesses and citizens on preparing for Exit.\r\n\r\nWith critical legislation in place including the EU Withdrawal Act, we are confident of the UK’s long term prospects in all scenarios.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Exiting the European Union","created_at":"2019-01-15T16:33:26.291Z","updated_at":"2019-01-15T16:33:26.291Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":233408,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/233408.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Review governance of National Insurance Fund","background":"Govt to establish independent review to take control of the National Insurance Fund out of the hands of The Treasury and also for contributors and pensioners to participate in governance of the Fund.","additional_details":"","state":"open","signature_count":13906,"created_at":"2018-11-19T15:02:41.100Z","updated_at":"2019-02-10T23:22:57.319Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-11-26T09:38:37.957Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-11-19T15:41:30.901Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2019-01-29T09:46:36.109Z","government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Joanne Welch","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":227744,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/227744.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Stop commercial reps from targeting new mothers on postnatal wards","background":"As new parents, we believe it is wrong that some commercial representatives have unlimited access to enter secure NHS postnatal wards, drop in uninvited on new mothers just hours after they have given birth, and pressurise them to share their personal data in exchange for a pack of free samples.","additional_details":"We are concerned that women are not being properly informed about how their data will be used.

However, the Government does take seriously the concerns shared about NHS Trusts allowing commercial representatives to approach new mothers in maternity wards shortly after they have given birth. New parents have a right to dignity and to feel safe and comfortable on NHS wards. This is particularly true for women in the period after giving birth when they may feel especially vulnerable.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) maternity inspection framework was updated to include lines of enquiry about the processes that Trusts have in place regarding the access of commercial representatives on postnatal wards. It is for individual trusts to make decisions about allowing commercial representatives access to postnatal wards.  However, as with all hospital visitors, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) expects trusts to have robust procedures in place to ensure that all representatives respect the privacy and dignity of all women and their families. \r\n\r\nAny commercial representatives speaking to patients within an NHS ward should provide clear information about how patient data will be used and ensure that they are operating in compliance of the Data Protection Act 2018. This is a matter for each individual Trust to consider, in line with their local practices.  Over the last year DHSC has been working alongside system partners within a National General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) Working Group to develop a comprehensive suite of guidance products to help organisations recognise their obligations, and put effective governance and risk management arrangements in place across health and social care. These are published on the NHS Digital website on a dedicated GDPR portal. This website can be accessed via the following link: \r\nhttps://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/looking-after-information/data-security-and-information-governance/information-governance-alliance-iga/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-guidance. \r\n\r\nIt is for individual organisations to take account of these guidance products when developing their own policies and risk management practices.\r\n\r\nIpswich hospital has introduced a system where mothers are only approached by a commercial representative if they indicate that this is something that they would like. Mothers can show their preference by placing a card on their bedside table. This is a good example of how Trusts can put processes in place to give new mothers clear control over their interaction with commercial representatives. The Government is considering how to clarify guidance, so that that the interaction between commercial representatives and new mothers on NHS wards is consistently more positive across the UK.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-25T16:10:22.616Z","updated_at":"2018-10-25T16:10:22.616Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":226975,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/226975.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Ban face coverings in public","background":"People can not be identified when the face is covered and people are becoming more offended and some even scared, with different gangs appearing all over and violent crimes are being committed.","additional_details":"","state":"open","signature_count":13873,"created_at":"2018-08-09T22:44:28.373Z","updated_at":"2019-02-10T22:13:43.804Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-08-17T12:33:33.683Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-08-10T12:35:38.456Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2018-12-11T18:45:17.174Z","government_response_at":"2018-12-21T08:24:47.871Z","debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Donna Hopkinson","rejection":null,"government_response":{"responded_on":"2018-12-21","summary":"The Government does not support a general ban on the wearing of face coverings in public.

","details":"The UK must have safe, secure and affordable supplies of energy with carbon emissions levels that are consistent with the carbon budgets defined in our Climate Change Act and our international obligations. We believe that gas has a key part to play in meeting these objectives both currently and in the future. Every scenario proposed by the Committee on Climate Change to meet our legally binding carbon reduction commitments includes demand for natural gas.\r\n\r\nIn part as a result of the UK’s diverse range of energy sources, which include natural gas, we have had competitively-priced energy since 1990 whilst reducing carbon emissions across the economy by 49% – a leading performance among developed nations. Gas still meets over a third of our energy demand and can have a long-term role – particularly alongside the development of carbon capture, utilisation and storage –  which is compatible with our climate change targets as we transition to a low carbon economy.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite the welcome improvements in efficiency and innovation from companies operating in the North Sea, the ongoing decline in our offshore gas production has meant that the UK has gone from being a net exporter of gas in 2003 to importing over half (53%) of gas supplies in 2017 and estimates suggest we could be importing 72% of our gas by 2030. Our current import mix, via pipelines from Norway and Continental Europe and LNG terminals that can source gas from around the world, provides us with stable and secure supplies. However, we believe that it is right to utilise our domestic gas and explore further the potential for onshore gas production from shale rock formations in the UK, where it is economically efficient, and where environment impacts are robustly regulated.\r\n\r\nIn the UK, we have been regulating for gas and oil drilling, both onshore and offshore, for decades and have world leading regulations in place to ensure on-site safety, prevent water contamination, and mitigate seismic activity and air pollution.\r\n\r\nOur tough regulatory system provides a comprehensive regime for exploratory activities.  Our position draws on independent reviews by the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering (2012), and Public Health England (2014).  These reports have considered a wide range of evidence and looked at the UK regulatory system, and hydraulic fracturing in the UK context.  The Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering concluded: “the risks can be managed effectively in the UK, if operational best practices are implemented and enforced through regulation.” \r\n\r\nMoreover, the Infrastructure Act (2015) introduced a range of additional safeguards if an operator wishes to carry out hydraulic fracturing, to provide the public with confidence that this industry is being taken forward safely.

HMRC encourages families to claim Child Benefit and believes that three months is a reasonable period to backdate claims. \r\n","details":"HMRC encourages parents to fill out the Child Benefit claim form as soon as their child is born. The form is distributed to all new parents following the birth of their child, is available online, and through partner organisations.\r\n\r\nParents are also advised to claim Child Benefit either:\r\n•\tThrough the HMRC helpline (0300 200 3100), \r\n•\tOnline at GOV.UK, or \r\n•\tThrough partners such as Citizen’s Advice.\r\n\r\nThrough these channels, HMRC stresses the importance of claiming Child Benefit to protect future entitlement to the new State Pension, even where the higher earner in a household is liable to the High Income Child Benefit Charge (HICBC). HMRC is continuously improving its communications to encourage people to claim as soon as they become responsible for a child, ensuring they receive the maximum protection available. From April 2019 the Child Benefit claim form and accompanying notes will further emphasise the non-monetary benefits a Child Benefit award provides: in particular, the associated National Insurance credits which protect their State Pension.\r\n \r\nOfficials are considering how to ensure no one misses out on their future entitlement to the State Pension. HMRC does not hold the details of those parents who have not made a claim for Child Benefit. \r\n\r\nAny parents that have not claimed should do so now to ensure their future entitlement for the State Pension is protected.  HMRC is working with DWP, and other organisations to promote the importance of claiming Child Benefit. In addition, HMRC is developing social media content and material that can be distributed to external partners, to further promote the importance of claiming.\r\n\r\nMost parents will qualify for the new State Pension, even if there are gaps of up to 15 years in their National Insurance records.  This means that those parents who have not claimed Child Benefit following the introduction of the HICBC still have the opportunity to achieve the full State Pension.  \r\n\r\nParents who claim Child Benefit can opt out of receiving payments so that they do not have to pay the HICBC each year through Self-Assessment. As of August 2017, over 500,000 families had chosen to make a Child Benefit claim and opt out of receiving payment, meaning their entitlement to the State Pension has been protected.\r\n\r\nWhere no one has claimed Child Benefit, the government allows claims to be backdated three months. A more generous backdating would make it harder to verify evidence and establish entitlement since entitlement to Child Benefit relies upon being responsible for a child each week. For this reason, the government believes that the three-month backdating period for Child Benefit (and the accompanying NI credit) is a fair and reasonable time in which to allow those wishing to claim Child Benefit to do so. \r\n\r\nHM Treasury\r\n","created_at":"2019-02-04T16:04:47.100Z","updated_at":"2019-02-04T16:04:47.100Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":237320,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/237320.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Increase early years funding in line with minimum pay rises","background":"The national minimum wage will increase again in April therefore the government needs to increase the childcare funding rates in line with these for settings to survive.","additional_details":"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/lpc-welcomes-acceptance-of-its-2019-minimum-wage-rate-recommendations\r\nhttps://www.pre-school.org.uk/sites/default/files/early_years_funding_rates_for_las_-_2019_2020.pdf","state":"open","signature_count":13357,"created_at":"2019-01-15T19:27:16.973Z","updated_at":"2019-02-10T23:37:05.177Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2019-01-28T13:40:13.080Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2019-01-16T16:34:10.815Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2019-02-05T07:02:00.762Z","government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Shaza Haq","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":231521,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/231521.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Ban all ISIS members from returning to UK","background":"Ban all ISIS members from returning to the UK, remove their citizenship and passports","additional_details":"By banning all returning ISIS members and by removing their citizenship and passports it would help keep the UK safe from terrorists and their actions.

Entitlement to State Pension is based on rules at the time of the claim.","details":"The equalisation of State Pension age was introduced against a background of a wide consultation on the policy.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, after 2 years of debate in Parliament and following public consultation, the Government brought in a law to equalise men and women’s State Pension age (SPa). This increased the earliest age when a woman could claim State Pension (SP) from 60 to 65. The Government planned for the original change to take place over 10 years between 2010 and 2020.\r\n\r\nThe Government has gone to significant lengths to communicate SPa changes. Over the last 18 years the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has provided over 25 million personalised State Pension estimates to people who requested them. It has encouraged people to request these as part of their long-term financial planning – after all, retirement is a life changing financial decision and people are expected to plan for this.\r\n\r\nThe equalisation of men and women’s SPa was often reported in the media and debated at length in Parliament. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) produced communications materials relating to increases in State Pension age (SPa) for both men and women, and carried out a pension’s education campaign between 2001 and 2004. This included information on the future equalisation of SPa. Later DWP sent individual letters to those affected. \r\n\r\nBecause of increases in life expectancy the Government needed to make further changes to State Pension age subsequent to Pensions Act 1995 to ensure that the state pension was affordable and sustainable over the long term. In 2007 it introduced a law to increase SPa for everyone to 66 by 2026, to 67 by 2036 and to 68 by 2046. In 2011 it introduced another law to equalise men and women’s SPa more quickly. The 2011 law also brought forward the increase in everyone’s SPa from 65 to 66 by five and a half years.\r\n\r\nThe terms of entitlement to State Pension has to be seen in the context that the State Pension is a Social Security benefit funded through National Insurance contributions.\r\n\r\nThe payment of the State Pension benefit is dependent on reaching the age of eligibility which can be amended through primary legislation. There is no legal contract for the pension between the state and an individual. The National Insurance scheme operates on a 'pay-as-you-go' basis. This means that today’s contributors are paying for today’s social security entitlements and pensions, and those paying contributions previously were paying for the pensioners of that time. In other words, contributors do not accumulate an individual pension fund of actual monies they have paid, which is personal to them. Instead, payment of contributions entitles them or, in certain circumstances, their spouses to a range of social security entitlements which are available on the basis of the rules applicable at the time of the claim.\r\n\r\nWith Government facing increasing financial pressures, it is simply not justified to reverse the policy on State Pension age equalisation. As an example, women who reached State Pension age in 2016 are estimated to receive more State Pension on average over their lifetime than women ever have before.\r\n\r\nWe will be making no further changes to the law on this issue. Doing so would mean working-age people, especially younger people, bearing a greater financial burden to support the rising costs of the pensions system. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions","created_at":"2018-12-20T22:32:55.398Z","updated_at":"2018-12-20T22:32:55.398Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":238071,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/238071.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Abolish leasehold","background":"Millions are trapped in this antiquated draconian leasehold system. \r\n \r\nThis is a “feudal” form of land ownership.\r\n\r\nIt is about time we Abolished Leasehold once and for all.","additional_details":"Professor Hopkins (law commissioner for England \u0026 Wales for property) recently gave evidence at the Leasehold Select Committee Inquiry stating “Looking at the landscape of leasehold legislation, I would have to say it is not fit for purpose as it is.\"\r\n \r\nThe leasehold system is a form of financial servitude where the leaseholder is forever compensating the freeholder for living on ‘their land’. \r\n\r\nCommonhold exists and should be compulsory.\r\n\r\nAim of National Leasehold Campaign : ABOLISH LEASEHOLD","state":"open","signature_count":12256,"created_at":"2019-01-23T12:33:15.448Z","updated_at":"2019-02-10T23:52:42.223Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2019-02-01T15:39:22.647Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2019-01-23T17:36:41.184Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2019-02-07T23:18:25.925Z","government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Katie Kendrick","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":231342,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/231342.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Abolish TV Licence","background":"A lot of people forced to pay for a TV Licence and they are not watching BBC on live broadcast or online.

We must respect both the will of the British people, and the democratic process which delivered this result.\r\n\r\nThere are no set rules about who can vote in a nationwide referendum in the UK. Instead, the franchise for each referendum is determined by the legislation for the referendum on a case by case basis.\r\n\r\nThe franchise for the referendum in 2016 was determined by the European Union Referendum Act 2015. The terms of the franchise set out in the Act were scrutinised and debated in Parliament during its passage and agreed by both Houses. In line with the franchise for UK Parliamentary elections, before any reform such as the Overseas Elections Bill, British citizens who had been resident overseas for less than 15 years and had previously registered to vote in the UK were permitted to vote in the referendum.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister has been clear that safeguarding the rights of EU citizens living in the UK and UK nationals living in the EU was her first priority for negotiations.

However, extensive arrangements are already in place to ensure people can access affordable prescriptions.","details":"While most NHS treatment is free at the point of use, there are some costs that people might need to pay. For example, in England many working age adults pay prescription charges, although some prescribed items are always free including contraceptives and medication for hospital inpatients. Prescription charges are a valuable income source for the NHS, contributing £575.9 million in revenue for the financial year 2017/18. This funding is particularly important given the increasing demands on the NHS.\r\n\r\nSome people are eligible for help with their health costs. This includes: NHS prescription charges, NHS dental treatment charges, the cost of travelling to receive NHS treatment, NHS wigs and fabric supports, and the cost of sight tests, glasses and contact lenses. Help with health costs in England depends on if the individual is in receipt of certain qualifying benefits, whether they are pregnant or have recently had a baby, whether they are aged 60 or over, under 16 years old, or are under 19 years old but are in qualifying full-time education, get a war pension or have a qualifying medical condition. Together these existing exemptions mean that around 90% of NHS prescriptions are currently dispensed free of charge.\r\n\r\nSickle cell anaemia is not currently listed as a qualifying medical condition for the purposes of help with health costs. Professor Sir Ian Gilmore undertook a review into extending exemptions to all those with long-term conditions, which was published in 2010. At this time, a decision was taken that no changes would be made in light of the financial challenges facing the country. This remains the position and the Government has no current plans to amend the list of medical conditions that provide exemption from NHS prescription charges.\r\n\r\nPeople with sickle cell anaemia may be eligible for one of the non-medical prescription charge exemptions and it is recommended they check. For convenience an eligibility checker tool is available on the NHS Business Services Authority’s (BSA) website at: \r\nhttps://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/check-for-help-paying-nhs-costs/start. \r\n\r\nThis tool has been widely publicised by the nationwide ‘check before you tick’ campaign, launched by NHS England and the NHS Business Services Authority (NHS BSA) to help people understand their eligibility for free NHS prescriptions.\r\n\r\nIn addition, people on low incomes can apply for help with their health costs through the NHS Low Income Scheme. The Scheme provides income related help to people who are not automatically exempt from NHS prescription charges but who may be entitled to full or partial help if they have a low income and savings below a defined limit. Further information, including on how to apply, is available on the NHS BSA’s website at: \r\nwww.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/nhs-low-income-scheme. \r\n\r\nThose people who are not eligible for help with health costs, yet have a high-level or long-term need for prescription medication, may be able to save money by purchasing a prescription prepayment certificate (PPC). These allow people to obtain as many prescriptions as they need for a set cost: £29.10 for a 3-month PPC and £104 for a 12-month PPC. In addition, people can spread the cost of a 12-month PPC by paying through 10 monthly direct debit payments.

The granting of felling licenses do not change this; they simply authorise the felling of growing trees.   ","details":"Forestry is a devolved matter; in England the control of tree felling is the responsibility of the Forestry Commissioners under their powers in Part II of the Forestry Act 1967 (as amended). In most circumstances a landowner will require a felling licence from the Forestry Commission before they can legally fell their trees. When considering a felling licence application, the Commission will judge the proposals against the UK Forestry Standard, the government’s approach to sustainable forestry. This standard encompasses the impacts on biodiversity and recognises the importance of priority habitats and species, including red squirrels. Applicants for a felling licence are therefore required to evidence how they propose to manage the impact of felling on wildlife. The Forestry Commission checks all applications against a large number of records, including Red Squirrel Reserves. This allows the Forestry Commission to highlight any potential issues and advise the applicant how to avoid the disturbance or damage of protected species.\r\n\r\nThe Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 makes it an offence to intentionally kill, injure or disturb a red squirrel or intentionally or recklessly damage any place a red squirrel uses for shelter or protection and a felling licence does not remove this responsibility. There is a defence if a person can show that the act was the incidental result of a lawful operation and could not reasonably have been avoided, but this would require them to demonstrate that they had followed good practice and taken all reasonable steps to avoid the disturbance or damage. The need to do this is brought to an applicant’s attention in a covering letter when they are issued with a felling licence.\r\n\r\nWhere other species are affected that are European Protected Species, the defence of an incidental result of a lawful operation does not apply and the landowner must carry out an assessment of the possible impact on protected species and, if necessary, apply for a licence from Natural England. \r\n\r\nWhere proposed tree felling sites carry statutory designations to protect important features, such as biodiversity, the Forestry Commission is required to consult other relevant authorities and seek their agreement as to the appropriateness of any tree felling. This consultation may result in additional advisory notes being applied to a felling licence. Any additional permissions or consents that may be required may also be generated at that time, for example, SSSI consent from Natural England.\r\n\r\nWe will be consulting on an English Tree Strategy later this year. This may provide an opportunity to consider the case for any further strengthening of the protection of wildlife during forestry operations, including timber harvesting, which is an important element of the sustainable woodland management cycle.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","created_at":"2019-01-29T13:12:16.858Z","updated_at":"2019-01-29T13:12:16.858Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":228286,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/228286.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Create minimum wage for SIA holders to be paid £15 per hour.\r\n ","background":"How many SIA staff would like to be paid a minimum of £15 per hour?

A revised policy framework is in development and we are consulting with stakeholders to understand relevant concerns. ","details":"The Government is committed to treating all those in its care with decency, fairness and respect, and the assessment and management of risk is of paramount importance in protecting the public, including those in the care of our prisons.  \r\n\r\nIn 2016, the Ministry of Justice conducted a policy review to ensure that the care and management of transgender offenders was fit for purpose and that it balanced the needs of individuals and the responsibility to safeguard the wellbeing of all prisoners.  As part of the review’s dialogue exercise, a questionnaire was circulated to stakeholders through a number of routes, including an established umbrella body with over 600 members in the voluntary sector, including specialist organisations working in women’s prisons and with female offenders.  This questionnaire asked what safety issues needed to be considered in women’s prisons when a transgender woman (male-to-female) was being considered for transfer.  There were 78 responses to the questionnaire overall, and 19 responses to the question about managing risk in women’s prisons.  As well as the questionnaire, written submissions were also invited, although none were received specifically from organisations representing women.  \r\n\r\nIn 2018 a review began into the instruction that had been issued by HM Prison and Probation Service in 2016 (PSI17/2016). This was to incorporate the learning from its first two years in operation.  As part of this process, the Ministry of Justice and HM Prison and Probation Service will again be engaging with relevant organisations that have expertise providing services to women.    \r\n\r\nThe new policy framework will ensure that all known risks – both towards or presented by a transgender person in prison – are taken into account.  It will factor in risks to all prisoners, especially those in the women’s estate, where many women will have been the victims of domestic violence or sexual abuse and may continue to be exceptionally vulnerable.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Justice recognises that the management of transgender offenders is often a complex and sensitive issue, and it continues to welcome all perspectives in the development in an area of policy that is expected to continue to evolve.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Justice.","created_at":"2019-02-04T18:08:36.686Z","updated_at":"2019-02-04T18:08:36.686Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":233043,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/233043.json"},"attributes":{"action":"End the animal cruelty laws exemptions given to UK halal and shechita abattoirs","background":"The EU’s 2009 slaughter regulation requires all animals, including poultry, be stunned before slaughter.
