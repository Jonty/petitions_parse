She acknowledged that it had been a difficult decision to make.\r\n\r\nIn determining whether or not to establish a statutory inquiry or other review, the Home Secretary considered a number of factors, reviewed a range of documents, carefully scrutinized the arguments contained in the Campaign’s submission and spoke to members of the Campaign. She concluded that neither an inquiry nor a review was required to allay public concern, more than 30 years after the events in question. In doing so, she noted the following factors:\r\n\r\n•\tDespite the forceful accounts and arguments provided by the campaigners and former miners who were present that day, about the effect that these events have had on them, ultimately there were no deaths or wrongful convictions.\r\n\r\n•\tIn addition, there have been very significant changes to policing since 1984, at every level, including major reforms to criminal procedure, changes to public order policing and practice, stronger external scrutiny and greater local accountability.\r\n\r\nIn particular the operational delivery and practice of public order policing has moved on a great deal from the arrangements in 1984, and tactics have now been reviewed and altered several times both by the police and the courts.\r\n\r\n•\tProtections which were singularly lacking at the time of Orgreave now exist with the introduction of the Police \u0026 Criminal Evidence Act 1984 which has vastly improved the way police investigations and powers operate.\r\n\r\n•\tThe creation of the Crown Prosecution Service in 1986, with the introduction of independent CPS prosecutors, fundamentally altered the prosecution of offences. It ended the existence of ad hoc prosecution arrangements across the country whereby a mixture of police prosecutors and private firms of solicitors - hired by the police and acting for and on the instruction of the police – conducted prosecutions.\r\n•\tWith regards to the external scrutiny of complaints against the police, this was strengthened by the creation, in 1985, of the Police Complaints Authority which was replaced in 2004 by the more effective Independent Police Complaints Commission and in turn will be replaced by the Office for Police Conduct in 2017. The exemplary standards of behaviour expected of everyone who works in policing were reinforced by the introduction of a statutory Code of Ethics, laid before this House in 2014.\r\n\r\n•\tLastly, the introduction of directly elected Police and Crime Commissioners in 2012 has given the public a voice in shaping their local policing priorities and improved the accountability of police leadership.\r\n\r\nAs a result there would therefore be very few lessons for the policing system today to be learned from any review of the events and practices of three decades ago. This is a very important consideration when looking at the necessity for an inquiry or independent review and the public interest to be derived from holding one. Taking these considerations into account, the Home Secretary does not believe that establishing any kind of inquiry is required in the wider public interest concern or for any other reason.\r\n\r\nThe Home Secretary believes that the focus should now be on continuing to ensure that the policing system is the best it can be for the future, including through reforms currently before Parliament in the Policing and Crime Bill, so that the public can have the best possible policing both in South Yorkshire and across the country.\r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2016-11-21T13:54:57.628Z","updated_at":"2016-11-21T13:54:57.628Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":163428,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/163428.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Prevent the closure of the Maternity Unit at Banbury Horton General Hospital","background":"Banbury is one of the largest towns in Oxfordshire and getting bigger.\r\nThe services of the Maternity ward at Horton Banbury save and support babies, mums and families and has done so in the past. \r\nHaving to go to the JR in Oxford is risking way too many lives.

This decision was based on there being insufficient numbers of middle grade obstetric doctors to staff the service safely.  The decision means that maternity services at Horton General Hospital will be offered temporarily by a Midwifery-led Unit (MLU), while efforts continue to fill vacant obstetric posts.   This is an emergency, temporary suspension of consultant-led obstetric and gynaecology services in Banbury from October 2016. Substantial and permanent service change would be subject to the four reconfiguration tests. \r\n \r\nWomen who would have attended the Horton General Hospital for an obstetric-led birth will be offered alternative provision at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. Other aspects of their antenatal and postnatal care will continue to be provided at the Horton General.\r\n \r\nCommunity midwives will continue to provide a home birth service in the Banbury area.  Antenatal clinics and postnatal drop in services and clinics will continue to be provided at the Horton General Hospital.  Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust’s consultant-led obstetric and gynaecology provision and special care baby unit services would shift to being provided solely at the John Radcliffe Hospital.  The Horton General (including its Emergency Department) would otherwise continue to provide its current range of services.   \r\n \r\nOxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the Horton General, has been struggling to fill middle grade obstetric doctor posts at the hospital for several months.  Should recruitment be successful for the middle grade obstetrician posts at the Horton General Hospital between September and October 2016, the trust would anticipate reinstating obstetric services at the Horton General from January 2017, allowing time for recruited staff to start work and for the necessary arrangements for other staff to be made.  If recruitment is not successful in that timescale, recruitment would continue, with potential reinstatement dates moving on by three-month blocks.\r\n \r\nOxfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group (OCCG) advises that it is developing a county wide transformation programme as part of the Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West Sustainability and Transformation Plan (STP) to shape the future of health care.  This will include options to make changes to acute and community bed based care including maternity services. The STP is part of the vision of the NHS Five Year Forward View for health and care services by 2020. \r\n \r\nIn June OCCG launched ‘the big health and care conversation’ to engage with public, patients and stakeholders in the development of its proposals to transform the way health and care are delivered in the county.  Public engagement will continue including  further engagement on  developing options for proposed service reconfiguration and further work with seldom heard people and groups in the county leading.\r\n \r\nEarly engagement has also taken place with the Health and Wellbeing Board and Health Overview and Scrutiny Committee (HOSC) as well as at a stakeholder engagement event in June 2016. Specific engagement on emerging options for services at the Horton General has centred on the Community Partnership Network – a local multi-stakeholder group.  \r\n \r\nA three month public consultation period on options is likely to commence at the end of this year.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2016-10-03T13:26:36.173Z","updated_at":"2016-10-03T13:26:36.173Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":168137,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/168137.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make dyslexia, dyspraxia and dyscalculia testing free on the NHS.","background":"Tests for these lifelong learning disabilities should be free for everyone.

","details":"The Government is committed to providing secure, affordable and clean energy, now and for the future. We need to replace our ageing infrastructure with low-carbon, reliable energy sources; and aim to do so through a mix of technologies and energy supplies, diversifying supply and reducing reliance on any one energy source. Keeping the lights on is non-negotiable.\r\n\r\nThe Government is clear that nuclear will be an important part of the future generation mix; a transition to a low carbon economy is key to our long term economic and environmental prosperity and, looking at the full costs to consumers, nuclear is both cost-competitive and low carbon. It is the only proven, large scale, low-carbon technology which provides base load supply. Currently, the UK has eight power stations which generate around 20% of electricity in the UK. Almost all of these existing power stations are due to close by 2030, and it is important we start to take action now to replace these.\r\n\r\nFollowing a review of the Hinkley Point C project, the Government has decided to proceed with the first new nuclear power station for a generation, subject to a number of conditions being accepted. Hinkley Point C will kick start a new era of nuclear power - building on Britain’s strong nuclear legacy – and help ensure the UK benefits from a diverse future energy mix designed to give consumers reliable and affordable low carbon energy. It will provide 7% of Britain’s electricity needs for 60 years. UK-based businesses will benefit from more than 60% of the £18 billion value of the project, and 26,000 jobs and apprenticeships will be created.\r\n\r\nThe Government is already committed to the renewable energy sector where it has a proven track record - nearly £52 billion has been invested since 2010. The average annual investment has more than doubled in the last 5 years, with an average of £9 billion invested each year in UK-based renewables. Annual support for renewable technologies will more than double, to over £10 billion, in 2020-21.\r\n\r\nSince 2010, the UK has more than trebled its renewable electricity capacity. Renewables’ share of generation increased by 6 percentage points on 2014 to a record 25% in 2015. For the first time, renewable sources provided more power over the year than coal. We are on track to comfortably exceed our ambition of delivering 30% of the UK’s electricity from renewables in 2020-21.\r\n  \r\nIn addition:\r\n•\tsolar PV has had rapid deployment over the past 5 years, with over 99% of the UKs capacity deployed since 2010 and almost 40% of the capacity (3.7GW) was installed in 2015\r\n•\tbio energy generation was 30% higher in 2015 compared to 2014\r\n•\toverall, wind generation was 26% higher than in 2014 and installed capacity 7.0% higher\r\n\r\nRenewables, such as wind farms, are intermittent and this is why the Government supports a balanced energy policy comprising a mix of sources, such as gas, nuclear and renewables.  With increased use of renewable energy, intermittency will become more of an issue and it is something we are planning for very carefully. We are seeking to keep energy bills down by not over incentivising technologies under low carbon incentive schemes. Furthermore, we are encouraging industry to drive down development costs, which is why the Contracts for Difference (CfD) strike price reduces over time.\r\n\r\nAs costs continue to fall, we will scale back support from sectors and redirect support to technologies where it is needed most. Onshore wind and solar costs have already fallen and so we have reduced support in those areas.\r\n\r\nThe Government is committed to providing investors with certainty and reducing risks for future investors. We are doing this whilst seeking to control costs that fall on consumers and ensuring that the Government’s other energy policy objectives, particularly on security of supply and climate change, are met.\r\n\r\nThe Government is clear that the transition to a low carbon economy is key to our long term economic and environmental prosperity; nuclear is part of that generation mix. Looking at the full costs to consumers, nuclear is cost-competitive and low carbon.

There are no plans to introduce a rate specifically for HGV drivers. ","details":"The objective of the National Minimum Wage is to ensure that low income workers are fairly paid. The National Minimum Wage clearly demonstrates the Government’s commitment to protecting those on the lowest incomes, and to making work pay. \r\n\r\nThe National Living Wage was introduced in April 2016 and it specifies the minimum hourly rate that workers aged 25 and over should be paid. The rate is currently set at £7.20 and from April 2017 it will be increased to £7.50. The Government’s objective is for the National Living Wage to equal 60 per cent of median earnings in the UK by 2020. Around 3 million low income workers are expected to benefit directly from the National Living Wage by 2020, and up to 6 million in total could see their pay rise as a result of a knock-on effect of the policy.\r\n \r\nIt is important that Government strikes a balance between setting National Minimum Wage rates which support workers, and on the other hand avoiding rates which are too high and which could lead to an increase in unemployment. The Government achieves this balance by considering the expert advice from the Low Pay Commission (LPC), which is independent of Government and involves representatives from both employer and worker groups. \r\n\r\nThe LPC makes recommendations to the Government on what the National Minimum Wage rates should be, such that there will be no impact on employment levels. The LPC does this by gathering extensive evidence from across the economy including workers, their representatives and employers. The LPC’s recommendation for the National Living Wage rate is calculated slightly differently in that the LPC is asked to recommend the rate such that it reaches 60% of median earnings by 2020. \r\n\r\nPay rates over and above the appropriate National Minimum Wage or Living Wage rate are a matter between employers and workers. It is the responsibility of employers to ensure that their reward packages are competitive, in order to retain and develop the workforces which are fundamental to their success.\r\n\r\nMany employers pay their workers more than the legal minimum, where it is affordable for them to do so. So long as they are paying at least the legal minimum, this is a decision for employers to take. Therefore, the Government has no plans to introduce a higher minimum wage rate specifically for HGV drivers. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy","created_at":"2017-01-04T11:25:53.173Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T11:25:53.173Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":168561,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/168561.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Stop Taxi's being allowed to work in areas they aren't licensed in.","background":"The Government has allowed Taxis to work cross boarders.

They have discretion to set standards that they deem to be appropriate for their area.\r\n\r\nThe standards for taxi and PHV licensing are set at a local level, this is usually the responsibility of the local authority. In London these standards are set by Transport for London. These licensing authorities have discretion to set standards that they deem to be appropriate for their area.\r\n\r\nAll local licensing authorities in England and Wales have a duty to ensure that any person to whom they grant a taxi or PHV driver’s licence is a fit and proper person to hold such a licence. Although the term ‘fit and proper’ is not defined in legislation, the procedure for assessing a driver’s fitness will typically involve an enhanced criminal record check and a medical check, a local topographical knowledge test and possibly a special driving test.\r\n\r\nThe Government publishes Best Practice Guidance to assist licensing authorities when setting standards for taxi and PHVs drivers and operators. The Government has introduced an amendment to the Policing and Crime Bill that will make statutory all aspects of the guidance related to the safeguarding of children and vulnerable adults. Both parts of the new guidance will be consulted on once the Policing and Crime Bill receives Royal Assent.\r\n\r\nLicensing authorities remain responsible for ensuring that the drivers they license remain fit and proper throughout the period of the licence. Any complaints about a driver can be investigated by the authority responsible for issuing the licence, regardless of where the driver was working at the time.\r\n\r\nIf vehicles from neighbouring areas present a problem, licensing authorities can work together to take joint enforcement action against all vehicles and drivers licensed in their combined areas. For example, in Merseyside, five licensing authorities allow each other to enforce against all vehicles and drivers across all of their areas.\r\n\r\nLegislation allows taxis to provide pre-booked journeys outside the area in which they are licensed, without a separate PHV licence. The Government considers that it is in the public interest to encourage taxis to accept fares that may take them out of the area in which they are licensed, for example to airports or train stations.\r\nThis concession has, in the past been open to abuse, with taxi drivers working predominantly accepting pre-booked fares outside the area in which they were licensed. The courts, while careful not to direct how a licensing authority should exercise its discretion to grant licences, have commented that it would be “difficult” to justify granting a taxi licence where a licensing authority knows the applicant has no intention of plying for hire in its area. It is the local licensing authority’s discretion as to whether or not to license such a vehicle, however to remain within the spirit of the legislation, the authority should consider the intended use of the licence.\r\n\r\nLocal licensing authorities are therefore able to address any local concerns that there may be about this issue. A number of local licensing authorities have already introduced a taxi ‘intended use’ policy when considering licence applications.\r\n \r\nThese policies are reducing the number of taxis working predominantly on pre-booked fares in other areas. If there are particular concerns in a specific area, these should be raised with the relevant licensing authorities.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-12T13:43:32.749Z","updated_at":"2017-01-12T13:43:32.749Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":168920,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/168920.json"},"attributes":{"action":"CCTV in ALL dementia care facilities by LAW.","background":"Too many incidents of abuse is happening to our elderly living with dementia in care facilities.

In order to support those most vulnerable to abuse and neglect, it is vital that agencies agree collectively those issues that require a safeguarding response as opposed to issues, which relate to standards and quality of care more widely.\r\n\r\nWe have made it clear, in statutory guidance to support implementation of the Care Act, that we expect local authorities to ensure that the services they commission are safe, effective and of high quality. We also expect those providing the service, local authorities and the Care Quality Commission (CQC) to take swift action where anyone alleges poor care, neglect or abuse. We have strengthened the powers of CQC to prosecute providers for unacceptable care, including abuse.\r\n\r\nBehaviour which amounts to abuse and neglect often constitutes specific criminal offences under various pieces of legislation. Although the local authority has the lead role in making enquiries where criminal activity is suspected, the early involvement of the police is likely to have benefits in many cases. \r\n\r\nThe Government recognises that cases of abuse and neglect have been exposed as the result of hidden cameras. We acknowledge that there are occasions when it may be appropriate for their use to be considered.\r\n\r\nClosed circuit television (CCTV) should not be regarded as a substitute for proper recruitment procedures, training, management and support of care staff, or for ensuring that numbers of staff on duty are sufficient to meet the needs of users of services.\r\n\r\nIt is a legal requirement that care providers must ensure that the safety, welfare, privacy and dignity of service users at all times. The Government considers that the widespread introduction of CCTV into care homes would raise important concerns about residents’ privacy, as well as practicality.\r\n\r\nThe use of CCTV and other forms of covert surveillance should not be routine, but should be considered on a case by case basis.  The Government does not object to the use of CCTV in individual care homes or by the families of residents, provided it is done in consultation with and with the permission of those residents and their families.\r\n\r\nCare providers and members of the public, including care service users and their families, are free to decide whether or not to employ CCTV or covert monitoring.

The plans look at supporting people to stay well, providing better coordinated services, improving hospital care and making most efficient use of resources and greater use of technology.\r\n\r\nOne of the many projects outlined in the STP is a review of how emergency care is delivered in Eastern Cheshire.  On 25 November, the Eastern Cheshire Caring Together Programme provided clarity on the future of the A\u0026E department at Macclesfield Hospital, giving an assurance that Macclesfield Hospital will continue to have an A\u0026E department.  The Caring Together Programme is currently exploring models of care that will ensure the future clinical and financial sustainability of services and that include the provision of an A\u0026E department at Macclesfield.

Clinicians are asking the government to reconsider its decision","additional_details":"SCD patients produce unusually shaped red blood cells that become stuck in blood vessels. Lack of tissue oxygen triggers sudden attacks requiring hospital treatment. The sickling can also cause organ damage, strokes, bone damage and disability. Denying funds for HSCT is an act of false economising that fails to consider the cost of repeated hospitalization. The procedure is safe and it's routinely used in the US. https://www.channel4.com/news/sickle-cell-bone-marrow-transplants-offer-hope","state":"open","signature_count":6133,"created_at":"2017-01-09T18:09:20.654Z","updated_at":"2017-01-28T23:52:32.981Z","open_at":"2017-01-13T15:16:21.360Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-01-09T20:30:16.686Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"creator_name":"Patrick Williams","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}}]}
