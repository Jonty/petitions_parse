After being placed on hold numerous times, he said the reason behind the restriction was due to a minimum fare of £3.90 between 4:30am -10am. This 'reduced' fare is actually the standard price and is available to everybody including Senior Citizens. So it still offers no valid explanation for this inverted ageism.
