Whilst this promotes \u0026 aids businesses, it also opens the floodgates to public safety. The training would be at the cost of the business. It would create jobs as well as assisting the businesses in gaining the scores that they should have \u0026 maintain high standards in the food industry \u0026 public safety.","state":"open","signature_count":6,"created_at":"2018-05-02T05:16:48.169Z","updated_at":"2018-05-08T13:16:08.178Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-05-08T13:16:03.346Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-05-02T15:52:36.287Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Adriana Craig","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":218065,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/218065.json"},"attributes":{"action":"By law all Emergency Services Persons to be served before members of public","background":"To make it compulsary by law that all on duty uniformed emergency services personnel are served at the front of ques in retail and food outlets to speed up the effieciency and working environments thus improving our response times and quality of staff","additional_details":"","state":"open","signature_count":6,"created_at":"2018-04-19T11:30:35.838Z","updated_at":"2018-04-26T17:05:48.575Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-04-26T17:05:48.570Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-04-19T19:01:22.454Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Karl Anthony Fisher","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":216680,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/216680.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Companies to accept all holiday requests from families during school holidays.","background":"For those being told that they can’t have a certain week off and then left to find AND PAY for childcare because their existing provider is closed!
