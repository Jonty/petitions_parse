","details":"The Government announced a review of the regulation of air weapons in England and Wales following a request from the Suffolk coroner in his report into the death of Benjamin Wragge, aged 13, who was accidentally shot with an air weapon in May 2016.\r\n\r\nAlthough no licence is required to possess most air weapons in England and Wales, they are nevertheless regulated. In particular, it is an offence for a person aged under 18 to purchase or hire an air weapon or ammunition, and it is an offence to sell, hire or gift an air weapon or ammunition to a person aged under 18. It is also an offence for a person aged under 18 to possess an air weapon or ammunition unless: \r\n•\tthey are being supervised by a person aged 21 or over, or \r\n•\tthey are shooting as a member of an approved target shooting club, or \r\n•\tthey are using air weapons at a shooting gallery, or \r\n•\tthe young person is aged 14 or over, is on private premises and has the consent of the occupier.\r\n\r\nThe Crime and Security Act 2010 brought in legislation concerned with reducing the risk of children getting hold of air weapons and accidentally harming themselves or others. This inserted a provision into the Firearms Act 1968 that requires owners to take reasonable precautions to prevent a person under the age of 18 from gaining unauthorised access to an air weapon. \r\nThe Government has sought the views of interested parties on relevant issues, including secure storage and the arrangements to prevent children gaining access to air weapons, manufacturing standards, and on the position in Scotland and Northern Ireland where air weapons are licensed. The Government has received a large number of representations about the review and these will be considered carefully before any decisions are made about how to proceed.\r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2018-03-14T10:36:30.590Z","updated_at":"2018-03-14T10:36:30.590Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":210497,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/210497.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Introduce super visa category for parents of British citizens similar to Canada","background":"Parents for British citizens  are treated differently if they reside in countries outside the EU and are not EU citizens and government has made the settlement of parents under ADR practically impossible so we are looking for a middle ground as it is done in Canada with SUPER VISA","additional_details":"With the parent and grandparent super visa, eligible parents and grandparents can visit family in Canada for up to two years without the need to renew their status .The Super Visa is a multi-entry visa that provides multiple entries for a period up to 10 years.

","details":"The UK welcomes genuine visitors to the UK. The visitor routes are for people who are coming to the UK for a temporary purpose, usually for up to six months. Visitors should not be living in the UK through frequent or successive visits or making the UK their main home. \r\n\r\nEvery visitor is assessed against the same Immigration Rules regardless of nationality. The only difference is where that assessment is made. Some individuals are assessed overseas by an entry clearance officer, while others are assessed at the UK border. All visitors to the UK are assessed against the Immigration Rules on a case by case basis.\r\n\r\nNationals of some non-EEA countries need a visa to visit the UK. Visas are an important part of securing the UK’s border and are an effective tool for the UK in reducing illegal immigration, tackling organised crime and protecting national security. \r\n\r\nAdopting a similar model to that of Canada and allowing a select group of people to remain in the UK for 2 years as visitors, would mean that important considerations against the Immigration Rules would not be applied consistently and could raise equality concerns. \r\n\r\nThe Government recognises the importance of family ties. Visit visas are available with validities of 6 months, 2 years, 5 years and 10 years, allowing individuals wishing to visit the UK regularly or at short notice to do so without having to apply for a new visa each time they wish to travel. \r\n\r\nThe family Immigration Rules were reformed in July 2012 to prevent burdens on the taxpayer, promote integration and tackle abuse, and thereby ensure that family migration to the UK is on a properly sustainable basis that it is fair to migrants and the wider community. \r\n \r\nWe reformed the route for adult dependent relatives, given the significant NHS and social care costs which can be associated with these cases.  The Department of Health has estimated that a person living to the age of 85 costs the NHS on average around £150,000 in their lifetime, with more than 50% of this cost arising from the age of 65 onwards.  This figure does not take account of any social care costs met by local authorities. \r\n\r\nUnder the rules, adult dependants must demonstrate that, as a result of age, illness or disability, they require a level of long-term personal care that can only be provided in the UK by their sponsor here and without recourse to public funds.  They must apply from overseas, not while in the UK as a visitor. \r\n\r\nAs well as the significant NHS and social care costs to which these cases can give rise, there are also broader issues of fairness.  Adult dependent relatives can continue to visit a family member in the UK (for up to six months) but must return home at the end of their visit: we do not allow visitors to switch into other immigration categories while in the UK and the adult dependent relative category should not be an exception.  There should also not be a routine expectation of settlement in the UK for parents and grandparents aged 65 or over.  Only those requiring long-term personal care that cannot be delivered in the country in which they are living should be eligible to settle in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe rules for adult dependent relatives seek to ensure that only those who need to be physically close to and cared for by a close relative in the UK are able to settle here.  Those who do not have such care needs can be supported financially in the country in which they live by their relative in the UK.  Those most in need of care remain most likely to qualify, compared with those who simply have a preference to come and live in the UK with a relative here.  The lawfulness of the rules was upheld by the Court of Appeal in May 2017. \r\n\r\nThe rules do not provide a route for every parent to join their adult child in the UK and settle here and it is not intended that they should do so.  Overall, the rules represent a fairer deal for the taxpayer, given the significant NHS and social care costs which can arise when adult dependent relatives settle in the UK.\r\n\r\nHome Office\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-03T11:36:09.186Z","updated_at":"2018-05-03T11:36:09.186Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":218343,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/218343.json"},"attributes":{"action":"End the animal cruelty laws exemptions given to UK halal and shechita abattoirs","background":"The EU’s 2009 slaughter regulation requires all animals, including poultry, be stunned before slaughter.

","details":"The Government recognises the valuable service that good letting agents provide to both landlords and tenants in ensuring that properties are safe, compliant and professionally managed. We are keen to see all tenants receiving a good and affordable service. A ban on letting fees paid by tenants will improve transparency and affordability for renters - letting fees are currently not clearly or consistently explained with the result that many tenants are unaware of the true costs of renting a property.\r\n\r\nThe Government published the draft Tenant Fees Bill on 1 November (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/draft-tenants-fees-bill), which sets out the detailed approach to banning letting fees to tenants in England, helping millions of renters by bringing an end to costly upfront payments and renewal fees.\r\n\r\nThe draft Tenant Fees Bill reflects feedback from the eight week public consultation (April – June 2017), which received over 4,700 responses. More than 9 out of 10 tenants who responded to the consultation backed the action to ban letting fees. We are ensuring that tenants will only be required to pay rent alongside a refundable deposit.\r\n\r\nMany letting agents and landlords acknowledge that fees charged to tenants are currently not at a level that is justifiable and agree that intervention is necessary. The Government does not believe that a cap would be effective and is likely to lead to a race to the top in terms of fees charged. A ban is easier to understand and enforce.\r\n\r\nWe believe that tenants will see a net saving as a result of the ban.  Tenants will be able to see what a given property will cost them in the advertised rent level without any additional hidden costs. This will help to make entering and moving around in the private rented sector easier and less costly.\r\n\r\nWe recognise that agents will need to consider their business models. The time of, and services provided by, letting agents should be reimbursed but this should be by landlords rather than tenants. Landlords are better able to shop around for the agent offering the service that they are seeking at the price they want to pay. It is also worth noting that landlords, unlike tenants, can claim tax relief on letting agent fees.\r\n\r\nGood letting agents, providing services that represent value for money to landlords, will continue to play an important role in the market. Furthermore, such letting agents will be on a fairer footing to compete for landlords’ business since it will be much harder for rogue agents to exploit their position between landlords and tenants. \r\n \r\nPublishing a bill in draft enables scrutiny of our proposals to ban letting fees by Parliament and stakeholders ahead of introducing legislation. The Communities and Local Government Select Committee is currently holding a public inquiry into the draft Bill. We welcome Parliamentary scrutiny on whether the draft Bill achieves its aim of delivering a fairer, more competitive, and more affordable lettings market where tenants have greater clarity and control over what they will pay and where the landlord is the primary customer of the letting agent. The Government will then seek to introduce the Bill formally to Parliament at the earliest opportunity. We will do this as soon as parliamentary time allows. We do not expect implementation to be before April 2019. This will allow letting agents time to prepare and re-negotiate their contracts.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Housing, Communities and Local Government","created_at":"2018-02-20T12:01:09.205Z","updated_at":"2018-02-20T13:48:40.475Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":216215,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/216215.json"},"attributes":{"action":"New law that cats injured/killed by a vehicle are checked for a chip: Round 2","background":"Why do we feel that cats aren't as important as dogs?
