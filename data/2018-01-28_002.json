This extensive process of consultation and evidence gathering included 192,000 consultation responses and engagement with over 300 organisations and experts.\r\n\r\nWe considered the question of funding during the BBC Charter Review process. While no funding model meets all the criteria of an ideal system, the current model provides the BBC with a sustainable core income paid by all households that watch or receive television. This model also has wider public support than any alternative - 60% of consultation responses indicated that no change was needed to the current licence fee model, and only 3% favoured full subscription funding. That is why we have committed to maintain the licence fee funding model for the BBC for the duration of this new 11 year Charter period.\r\n\r\nThe BBC has committed to consider whether elements of subscription have a role to play in its future funding, alongside the core licence fee model. It is for the BBC to set the scope of these plans, but the government expects that progress and success will be appropriately reviewed, to feed into the next Charter Review process.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","created_at":"2017-10-17T14:25:18.860Z","updated_at":"2017-10-17T14:25:18.860Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":"2017-11-20","transcript_url":"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2017-11-20/debates/CF3F652E-0E66-4089-A30D-D9229792E31A/TVLicenceFee","video_url":"http://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/d25effd4-66ce-4997-af96-db4b83265051","debate_pack_url":"http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CDP-2017-0172/CDP-2017-0172.pdf","overview":""}}},{"type":"petition","id":200311,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200311.json"},"attributes":{"action":"No referendum on the final deal for the UK to remain in the European Union.","background":"We, the undersigned, herby call upon HM government to dismiss calls for a referendum on the final deal as the British people were asked an important question on the 23rd June last year, the choices were abundantly clear, remain or leave the European Union and leave won a decisive vote.","additional_details":"The attempts to propose yet another referendum and poise a set of questions to the British public on the final deal is a distasteful proposal, considering we were already given a free and fair referendum last year, to now agree to another referendum would be an appalling waste of taxpayers money and send out the wrong message to the British public that the vote last year was meaningless.\r\n\r\nThe referendum should not be re-run just to placate individuals unable to accept a democratic decision.","state":"open","signature_count":14250,"created_at":"2017-09-14T16:38:38.437Z","updated_at":"2018-01-27T18:23:34.611Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-09-15T14:47:10.588Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-09-14T18:35:14.683Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2017-10-04T19:19:10.424Z","government_response_at":"2017-10-17T15:45:55.758Z","debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":"2017-12-12T10:17:56.298Z","creator_name":"Thomas Barnes","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"On 23 June 2016 the British people voted to leave the European Union.

The Government does not intervene in the way that road closures are managed for Remembrance Sunday Parades. ","details":"The Government fully recognises the enormous sacrifices that have been made by British military personnel. Remembrance ceremonies and parades are an important and valued means by which communities across the country honour the sacrifice of British service personnel.\r\n\r\nWe are very sensitive to the pressures the police face. We recognised the importance of wider policing in the 2015 Spending Review, which protected overall police spending in real terms. Also nationally, the police hold over £1.6 billion of financial reserves.\r\n\r\nForces are expected to hold reasonable contingencies in their budgets to cover the costs of policing events, particularly annual ceremonial events such as Remembrance Sunday parades. Additional funding is normally only considered in respect of special events where their policing costs exceed one per cent of a police force’s total funding, or where meeting these costs would place a force at financial risk.\r\n\r\nThere is no Government policy on road closures for Remembrance Sunday Parades and there is no proposal to introduce legislation. It is for the local traffic authority (that is, the council of the relevant county or metropolitan district, not the police) to decide on the road closure or other legally enforceable traffic management measures it considers necessary for the conduct of any local on-road event. These are decisions for which it is responsible to its electorate. \r\n\r\nRoad closures for local Remembrance Sunday Parades are effected through Traffic Regulation Orders made under section 16A of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. Section 16A is used to close roads temporarily for \"sporting events, social events or entertainment\", collectively known as special events. Under section 16A, a local traffic authority can impose temporary highway restrictions for a special event once and for up to three days in any calendar year. \r\n\r\nRestrictions for special events over and above this that affect the same length of road require the consent of the Secretary of State for Transport. Otherwise, the Department for Transport does not get involved and the event remains purely a local matter. Where the Secretary of State’s consent is required, the Department does not impose conditions on the way that the road is to be closed and does not charge the local authority for granting consent. \r\n\r\nAs with any event, decisions on the deployment of resources to police road closures are operational matters for the Chief Constable of the force concerned, in association with Police and Crime Commissioners. The Police have not and do not routinely police Remembrance Parades and are more likely to determine the level of policing required for an event on the basis of an assessment of crime, disorder and public safety. \r\n\r\nThe police’s role is to enforce the general law on road traffic and any special measures introduced for the event in question, such as a local Traffic Regulation Order. They also have a general power to direct traffic. The authority or police may advise the local community on other steps that might be taken and associated measures that might be desirable, such as the taking out of insurance. How the police carry out enforcement is a matter for their discretion.\r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2017-11-08T09:57:36.327Z","updated_at":"2018-01-09T17:19:09.506Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":200952,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200952.json"},"attributes":{"action":"House of Commons vote on whether Brexit should be cancelled.","background":"Brexit was initiated on the basis that it was the 'will of the people' and the Government needed to act on that.

Based on expert advice, it offers protection to those at highest risk.","details":"Vaccination saves lives – it prevents disease, disability and death. It is a vital way to protect children (and others) against a range of serious diseases and we strongly encourage families to take up vaccinations when offered. \r\n\r\nAll our vaccination programmes are based on expert review of the evidence from the Joint Committee on Vaccination \u0026 Immunisation (JCVI) – it bases its recommendations on a comprehensive review of a wide range of scientific and other evidence, including from the published literature, and commissioned studies such as independent analyses of vaccine effectiveness and cost effectiveness. https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/joint-committee-on-vaccination-and-immunisation\r\n\r\nMen B is a terrible disease and the Department would like to extend its deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Layla Rose Ermenekli. However, the UK MenB vaccination programme is based on the advice of the JCVI.  The JCVI recommended that MenB immunisation should be routinely offered to the group of children at the highest risk, and reviewed all available evidence in determining their advice.\r\n\r\nTheir advice is summarised in the following statement:\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/meningococcal-b-vaccine-jcvi-position-statement\r\n\r\nFollowing JCVI’s recommendation, the UK is proud to have been the first country to introduce a national, publically funded MenB immunisation programme for infants using the Bexsero® vaccine. Since September 2015, all infants aged two months have been offered the MenB vaccine, followed by a second dose at four months and a booster at 12 months. Since May 2017, all children under two have become eligible for vaccination. The vaccine is also available to a small number of older children and adults who are at an increased risk of infection, such as those with specific underlying medical conditions. \r\n\r\nThe JCVI keeps the eligibility criteria of all vaccination programmes under review and considers new evidence as it emerges. The JCVI has considered older age groups (1-4 year olds) but did not advise a catch up programme. The JCVI have also requested further research to reduce uncertainty and give a greater level of confidence on whether a vaccination programme for adolescents would be cost effective. Specifically, the JCVI have requested a study of the effect of MenB vaccination on the carriage of meningococcal strains in adolescents. An open competition process has been carried out, and completed, to commission this work, which the selected research team could potentially begin by the end of 2017.\r\n\r\nMenB is, thankfully, very rare and incidence has been declining since 2000/2001. There were about 1,600 cases of MenB in 2000/01 compared to 444 MenB cases in 2015/16 and the vaccine protects against the majority of MenB strains for infants and those who are at risk of meningococcal disease. \r\n\r\nThere are, however, strains of group B meningococcal bacteria which are not covered by the vaccine and cases can still occur in vaccinated infants and children. It is therefore very important for parents to be alert to the symptoms of meningococcal disease such as fever, blotchy skin, refusal to feed, irritability, cold hands and feet, rash, muscle pain, and a stiff body with jerky movements or else floppy and lifeless. Parents should trust their instincts and seek urgent medical attention if they have concerns. Further information is available publically on the NHS choices website; https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Meningitis/Pages/Introduction.aspx \r\n\r\nPublic Health England (PHE) has been collaborating with charities about how best to help parents understand the signs and symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia.

In areas identified as especially high risk, such as the hard shoulder on motorways, the Department for Transport placed a specific responsibility on Highways England, under the Infrastructure Act 2015, to have due regard to the need to protect and improve the safety of the strategic road network as a whole for all road users. This includes ensuring that roadside vehicle recovery operations are safe for both recovery drivers and all other road users. \r\n\r\nAs a first step towards this goal, the Government set a challenging target. Highways England has a target to reduce those killed or seriously injured on their strategic road network, of a decrease of at least 40% by the end of 2020 against the 2005-09 average baselines. Further details on Highways England’s Health \u0026 Safety 5 year plan is available on the Highways England website: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/highways-england-health-and-safety.\r\n\r\nRules 219 and 281 of the Highway Code provide for emergency and incident support vehicles and their corresponding warning signs or flashing lights. These rules advise drivers to be aware of emergency or incident support vehicles on the road: it provides advice on which warning lights or signals these vehicles use, and advises drivers to exercise extra care and attention including slowing down, being prepared to stop, and to follow any directions given by police officers, or traffic officers, as to whether drivers can safely pass an incident or blockage.\r\n\r\nWhether on the strategic road network or on local roads, the police already have powers to deal with road users who do not slow down or move over for vehicles that have broken down or been involved in accidents on the roadside. Road users, are required to comply with road traffic law in the interests of their own safety and that of other road users. If road users do not adopt a responsible attitude, or if their use of the highway creates an unsafe environment or causes a nuisance, they may be committing a number of offences. For example, under sections 2 and 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (as amended) a person may be charged with the offences of dangerous driving, or careless and inconsiderate driving. In each case it is for the police to enforce the law.\r\n\r\nThe Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 also requires employers to ensure the safety of their employees during the course of their work. HSE would expect that employers have arrangements in place to ensure that safe working procedures are used, vehicles and equipment of an appropriate standard are provided and maintained, where necessary, appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) is provided and used, and all persons have been adequately trained by a competent person on how to work safely at the roadside and the precautions they should be recommending to the occupants of incident support vehicles.

We recognise the importance for people with ADHD of receiving a timely diagnosis and appropriate support. Current legislation and guidelines set out how services should support people of all ages with ADHD. \r\n\r\nIn 2016, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published a guideline on diagnosing and managing ADHD for people aged 3 and above. This aims to improve the diagnosis of ADHD as well as the quality of care and support for people with an ADHD diagnosis. An updated guideline is expected to be published in February 2018.\r\n\r\nThe Care Act 2014 represents the most comprehensive reform of social care legislation in over 60 years. The Act puts in place requirements for local authorities to meet a person’s eligible care and support needs, including those of people with ADHD, and to help and protect people with care and support needs, who may be at risk of abuse or neglect as a result of those needs. \r\n\r\nThe Government recognises that children and young people with ADHD often need special educational provision and under the Children and Families Act (2014), local authorities, health and care services must commission services jointly to ensure the needs of children and young people with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) are met. Local Authorities must publish a clear outline of services available which has been developed for, and with, parents and young people. \r\n\r\nWe have also introduced a more streamlined assessment process to develop Education, Health and Care plans to support children and young people with SEND. These are co-ordinated across education, health and care, and involve children and young people and their families throughout the process.\r\n\r\nThese measures aim to reduce health inequalities and improve outcomes for children and young people with SEND and their families.  \r\n\r\nWe recognise that having ADHD can lead people to experience mental health problems and the Government is committed to improving mental health support and services.

The display of the European flag with the inclusion of a GB identifier, called the Europlate, enables motorists to travel within the European Union without the need to display the conventional oval ‘GB’ sticker to identify the member state in which the vehicle is registered.  Currently, UK motorists travelling within the EU can display either the traditional oval GB sticker or the Europlate.
