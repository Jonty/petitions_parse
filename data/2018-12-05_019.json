With the increasing number of nut allergy’s reported each year as well as the number of deaths I think this is extremely important to raise awareness. The NHS reported 4000 new nut allergy’s in 2005 and the number of the diagnosis’ rise each year. It is crucial that more visibility is present in the beauty industry. Some companies name the nuts as clinical terms, making it harder for the sufferer to be aware.","state":"open","signature_count":31,"created_at":"2018-09-30T17:41:09.002Z","updated_at":"2018-11-11T22:39:10.861Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-10-18T09:54:11.104Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-09-30T18:10:43.953Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Olivia Witter","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":228319,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/228319.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make emotional abuse and bullying a criminal offence","background":"Unless there has been a threat of violence, nothing can be done to stop emotional abuse.
