On-line gambling specifically presents easy opportunities 24/7/365 for people to succumb to temptation to bet beyond their means, without even leaving their homes, and without regard for consequences. There is only one effective solution, which is to ban on-line gambling completely, by making it illegal in the UK","state":"open","signature_count":9,"created_at":"2018-11-21T22:42:00.355Z","updated_at":"2018-12-10T10:23:58.872Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-12-06T15:45:35.750Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-11-24T12:13:03.578Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Alun Rhys Jones","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":233274,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/233274.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Abolish married couple's allowance and marriage allowance","background":"This legislation is outdated and discriminatory.
