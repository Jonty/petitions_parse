This Act sets out the process by which trans people can legally change their gender. We will publish this consultation in due course. All members of the public will be able to respond to the consultation. Once the consultation has closed and the Government has carefully considered the responses, only then will we decide how to reform the GRA. \r\n\r\nGender recognition is a devolved issue and the Scottish Government ran a separate consultation, which closed on 1 March 2018.\r\n \r\nWe have been clear since announcing our intention to consult on the GRA that we will ask about how we can make the process of applying for a Gender Recognition Certificate less bureaucratic and intrusive for trans people. That does not necessarily mean we are proposing self-declaration of gender. The Government will consider the results of the consultation carefully before making any decision on how to reform the GRA. We are clear that we have no intention of amending the Equality Act 2010, the legislation that allows for single sex spaces. Any GRA reform will not change the protected characteristics in the Equality Act nor the exceptions under the Equality Act that allow provision for single and separate sex spaces.\r\n\r\nThe Government does not intend to change the safeguarding processes that are currently used in refuges and healthcare services. Providers of women-only services can continue to provide services in a different way, or even not provide services to trans individuals, provided it is objectively justified on a case-by-case basis. The same can be said about toilets, changing rooms or single sex activities. Providers may exclude trans people from facilities of the sex they identify with, provided it is a proportionate means of meeting a legitimate aim. \r\n\r\nWe are committed to a respectful and evidence-based discussion, and, for this reason, we have engaged in many pre-consultation meetings with a range of stakeholders including women’s groups, charities and service providers. We will continue to do so during the consultation. The consultation offers an opportunity for women from all backgrounds to be heard.\r\n \r\nAs part of our evidence gathering, we are looking at the experiences of other countries who have different gender recognition models. There are countries, such as Ireland, Malta, and Belgium that have adopted a self-declaration model, making use of statutory declarations. We are also looking at countries that do not have a full self-declaration model, such as the Netherlands. \r\n\r\nWe want to emphasise that any reform of the GRA will not mean reform to the medical treatment that trans people receive, and the age at which they can receive this. Access to treatment on the NHS, including cross-sex hormones (which the NHS allows from 16) and surgery (which the NHS allows from 18), is not regulated by the GRA, but decided on by clinicians. Any GRA reform will not change this.\r\n\r\nWhen the GRA was introduced, it was considered a world-leading piece of legislation. Whilst it has worked well in many ways, over the last decade it has been viewed as outdated. We have heard from many trans people that the current requirements feel overly intrusive and bureaucratic. It includes the need to provide a diagnosis of gender dysphoria and a second medical report of any treatment, proof of having lived for at least two years in their acquired gender, the approval of their spouse if married, as well as the fee to apply, and any associated costs with obtaining supporting evidence. Furthermore, trans people are already able to more easily change their name and gender in their passport and driving license. Streamlining the process of changing their legal gender on their birth certificate, so that they are recognised legally in their acquired gender, would help trans people to have all their identity documents match. \r\n\r\nThe process of gaining a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC), as set out in the Gender Recognition Act, is a Government service that is not working well for the people it is designed for. Only 4,850 GRCs have been issued since the Act came into force. Our research shows that trans people find the process too bureaucratic and hard to use. We therefore propose improving this service, but want to ensure we only do so after a full consultation, to allow us to hear from trans people, and also from women’s groups, faith groups, LGBT groups, young people’s organisations, charities, refuges, and many more individuals and organisations, so that we can decide how best to make these reforms.\r\n\r\nThe Government is committed to improving the position of women and girls, and supports their rights, safety, privacy and dignity. We are also committed to improving the position of trans people and supporting their rights. We are confident that advancing the rights of trans people does not have to compromise women’s rights, and will work with all groups to ensure this.\r\n\r\nGovernment Equalities Office","created_at":"2018-06-05T09:27:51.923Z","updated_at":"2018-06-05T09:27:51.923Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":214210,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/214210.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Accept a role as guarantor to the USS pension scheme","background":"The USS pension deficit is due to a \"self sufficiency in gilts\" valuation method that models what would happen if the pre-92 universities went bankrupt.

The Home Office has no plans to mandate re-homing of animals used in scientific research.\r\n\r\nThe use of animals in scientific research remains a vital tool in improving our understanding of how biological systems work both in health and disease.

This is achieved through applying the principles of the 3Rs which require that, in every research proposal, animals are replaced with non-animal alternatives wherever possible; that the number of animals used is reduced to the minimum needed to achieve the results sought; and that, for those animals which must be used, procedures are refined as much as possible to minimise their suffering.\r\n\r\nAnimals that have been used in scientific research under ASPA may be re-homed if certain criteria, which are set out in section 17A of ASPA, are met.

If however, all suitable treatments fail, or cease to provide benefit to the patient, they may, ethically and legally, be withheld or withdrawn, and the focus of treatment changed to the relief of symptoms. In practice, the decision to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment is of course, often very difficult.  \r\n\r\nDoctors, nurses and other clinicians who are delivering care to severely ill patients are required at all times to have regard to the best interests of the patient when considering what treatment is appropriate and indeed, whether to continue life sustaining treatment. \r\n\r\nWhere there is disagreement between those with parental responsibility and treating clinicians about a child’s treatment, including whether to continue life sustaining treatment, the court will be asked to determine what is in the child’s best interest. The views of the parents will be very important in the court reaching decisions, but it is the child’s best interests that are paramount, not the rights of those with parental responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe power to consent must be exercised according to the ‘welfare principle’: that the child’s ‘welfare’ or ‘best interests’ must be paramount. Even where a child lacks capacity to consent on their own behalf, it is good practice to involve the child as much as possible in the decision-making process. \r\n\r\nIf children have the capacity to give consent for themselves, consent should be sought directly from them. Once young people reach the age of 16, they are presumed in law to be competent to give consent for themselves for their own surgical, medical or dental treatment, and any associated procedures, such as investigations, anaesthesia or nursing care. Those under 16 are not automatically presumed to be legally competent to make decisions about their healthcare. Under-16s will be competent to give valid consent to a particular intervention if they have sufficient understanding and intelligence to enable him or her to understand fully what is proposed.  If a child is not competent to give consent for themselves, consent should be sought from a person with parental responsibility. \r\n\r\nAs is the case where patients are giving consent for themselves, those giving consent on behalf of child patients, must have the capacity to consent to the intervention in question, be acting voluntarily and be appropriately informed.

Since 2010 rates of survival from cancer have increased year-on-year.  Around 7,000 people are alive today who would not have been had mortality rates stayed the same as in 2010.  But we know there is more to do, and NHS England is leading the health and care system in implementing the recommendations of the independent Cancer Taskforce to save a further 30,000 lives a year by 2020.\r\n\r\nPublic Health England (PHE) plans to work with stakeholders to pilot and assess the feasibility of using existing data sources to support an ovarian cancer audit; this pilot will take place over the next two years.  NHS England is continuing to work with its partners (NHS improvement, Care Quality Commission) and others to ensure its portfolio of cancer audits is as comprehensive and representative as possible within the allocated resources.  An audit of ovarian cancer is being considered as part of this.  NHS England plan to hold discussions over the next six months on potential new clinical audit topics including ovarian cancer. \r\n\r\nSince early diagnosis increases survival outcomes, NHS England is working to diagnose cancer earlier and faster.  This is particularly important for cancers like ovarian, where early diagnosis makes a huge difference in survival.  We are developing new models of care and pathways that will transform services by speeding up diagnosis.  This includes the commitment to roll out a new Faster Diagnosis Standard by 2020 to ensure that patients referred for an investigation with a suspicion of cancer are diagnosed or have cancer ruled out within 28 days. \r\n\r\nNHS England has also committed more than £200 million between 2017 and 2019, to accelerate diagnosis, improve survival and enhance quality of life.   \r\n\r\nNHS England is introducing Rapid Diagnostic and Assessment Centres which will operate as one-stop shops to reduce time-to diagnosis and time-to-first treatment. This is a real step change in the way people with unclear symptoms are identified, diagnosed and treated. GPs can refer patients suffering from vague symptoms. \r\n\r\nThe Department of Health and Social Care is also closely working with PHE to develop an approach to raise awareness of generic symptoms that can indicate a wider number of cancers, including ovarian cancer, and the need to visit the doctor promptly with these symptoms.\r\n\r\nPHE also ran a regional pilot ovarian campaign in the North West of England from 10 February to 16 March 2014. The campaign’s key message was ‘Feeling bloated, most days, for three weeks or more could be a sign of ovarian cancer. Tell your doctor’.\r\n\r\nThe government accepts that cancer survival in England has historically lagged behind the best performing countries in Europe and the world.  However, it is difficult to compare in a meaningful way due to time lag and issues with data completeness.  There are different regional practices in data collection and variation in data completeness, e.g. often regional rather than national data is compared.  As a result, we should be careful about using these comparisons as a measure of the current performance of the system, although they can be useful as a long-term benchmark.  The International Cancer Benchmarking Partnership are due to publish their latest analysis in the autumn.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care","created_at":"2018-08-15T14:36:13.018Z","updated_at":"2018-08-15T14:36:13.018Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":213702,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/213702.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Require local authorities to adopt all Public Open Space and roads on estates","background":"Local authorities are avoiding increasing their grounds maintenance responsibilities on new private estates by requiring developers to form management companies to deal with the maintenance long term.

We will keep I CAN and the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists updated on progress.","details":"We welcome the Bercow Ten Years On report and it raises some important issues. The government is currently considering the report and an appropriate response will be provided in due course.  \r\n\r\nSpeech, language and communication skills are fundamental in helping children and young people flourish in life, and the government is firmly committed to ensuring that those with speech, language and communication needs (SLCN) receive the support they need to reach their full potential.\r\n\r\nA lot of progress has been made since the original Bercow report was carried out 10 years ago. The Government has introduced, through the Children and Families Act 2014, a framework for ensuring that children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND), including those with SLCN, are identified early and receive the support they require to have their needs met to succeed in education and successfully move into independent adult life. \r\n\r\nIt is widely acknowledged that children who start school with strong foundations have a better chance of getting on in life. That is why, in December, the Government published Unlocking Talent, Fulfilling Potential – a plan for improving social mobility through education. The plan includes a commitment to close the ‘word gap’ in the early years.\r\n\r\nAs part of the government’s ambitious plans, the Department for Education is working with the Department of Health and Social Care and Public Health England to support health visitors and early years practitioners identify and support children’s early SLCN.  We are also investing £5m in trials to support parents to improve their children’s language development and discover what works to improve home learning, and £50 million to improve early language and literacy provision. This includes a new national network of English Hubs funding to enhance early years practitioners’ professional development, and a £5m what works fund in partnership with the Education Endowment Foundation.\r\n\r\nOver the years, the government has funded the development of resources and training materials to ensure that the schools workforce is equipped to support pupils with specific types of SEND, including those with SLCN.  A more strategic approach is now needed to ensure that knowledge is embedded in the educational workforce and that good practice is disseminated and widely understood.\r\n\r\nA new schools’ workforce contract has recently been awarded to Nasen in partnership with UCL, to encourage schools to prioritise SEND within their continuous professional development (CPD) and school improvement plans, and to equip them to identify and meet their training needs. This contract will look across all types of impairment, including SLCN, and will undertake a gap analysis of training and resources for the educational workforce.  The findings of this research will be used to identify what further support might be required in the future.\r\n\r\nThe Government is committed to responding to Dame Christine Lenehan’s review of residential special schools, Good Intentions, Good Enough?, later in the year.  We will take that opportunity to set out how the government will continue to work to achieve the vision of a reformed SEND system.  This will also provide an opportunity to draw out some of the common themes between the Lenehan review and the Bercow Ten Years On report. \r\n\r\nWe have been in regular contact with I CAN and the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists in respect of the report’s recommendations, and we will continue to keep them updated on the progress we are making.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education","created_at":"2018-07-03T16:39:30.333Z","updated_at":"2018-07-03T16:39:30.333Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":217985,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/217985.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Bring in laws to protect horses being ridden on roads","background":"Horses need legal protection from drivers who hit or kill horses being ridden on the roads, as it stands the only law is dangerous driving around horses which is hard to prove as the highway code only gives ADVICE on how to pass horses which means drivers cannot be prosecuted. laws need updating","additional_details":"Horses are being left  dead on our roads with no compensation to the owner or business.

The relevant offences include driving dangerously, driving without due care and attention and driving without reasonable consideration for other road users, as set out in Rule 144 of The Highway Code. The Highway Code can be viewed online at: \r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-highway-code\r\n\r\nAlthough failure to comply with the ‘advisory rules’ of the Code will not, in itself, cause a person to be prosecuted, The Highway Code may be used in evidence in any court proceedings (under the Traffic Acts) to establish liability. This includes the rules which use advisory wording, such as ‘should/should not’ or ‘do/do not’. \r\n\r\nEnforcement of the law is a matter for the police, who will decide on the evidence in each individual case whether an offence has been committed and the appropriate action to take. \r\n\r\nThe Department recognises the importance of the safety of both riders and their horses, on public roads. Every opportunity is taken to remind motorists of their responsibilities towards vulnerable road users, including horse riders. The Highway Code provides the following advice: \r\n\r\nRule 163:\r\nOvertake only when it is safe and legal to do so.\r\n\r\nYou should give motorcyclists, cyclists and horse riders at least as much room as \r\nyou would when overtaking a car.\r\n\r\nRule 215\r\nHorse riders and horse-drawn vehicles. Be particularly careful of horse riders and horse-drawn vehicles especially when overtaking. Always pass wide and slowly. Horse riders are often children, so take extra care and remember riders may ride in double file when escorting a young or inexperienced horse or rider. Look out for horse riders’ and horse drivers’ signals and heed a request to slow down or stop. Take great care and treat all horses as a potential hazard; they can be unpredictable, despite the efforts of their rider/driver.\r\n\r\nThrough the THINK! Road Safety Campaign, the Department has previously worked with the British Horse Society (BHS) to support their “Dead Slow” campaign to encourage car drivers to pass horses safely. The Department was able to reinforce the BHS campaign by developing a short film that is being promoted as a public information film on UK TV stations. \r\n\r\nThe Department invested in promoting the film on YouTube and other social media, such as Twitter and Facebook. Leaflets and posters to support the campaign further reminded motorists of the need to be patient when they encounter horses on the road, and supplemented the advice already given in The Highway Code. The leaflets and posters are available free of charge from the THINK! online shop and they are often used by riding groups to support local campaigns. Road safety officers around the country were also encouraged to feature the campaign locally. \r\n\r\nThe driving theory test contains questions about how drivers should interact with vulnerable road users, including horse riders and the hazard perception test includes a number of clips where horse riders are the hazard, either directly or indirectly. These clips are refreshed and updated periodically.\r\n\r\nWhere there may speed related issues: The local traffic authorities are responsible for setting speed limits on local roads. They have the flexibility to set local speed limits, that are appropriate for the individual road, reflecting local needs and taking account of local considerations.

Parents and those who work with children are concerned about the effects of energy drink consumption on children's health and behaviour. \r\n\r\nWe know that a significant proportion of children in this country are drinking these products. A 2013 study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) found that 69% of UK 10-18 year olds had consumed energy drinks in the last year, and that adolescents who do consume energy drinks are drinking 50% more of them by volume than the EU average for their age group.

It is therefore potentially concerning that EFSA research suggests that nearly a quarter (24%) of 10-17-year-olds who consume energy drinks drink 3 cans or more in one sitting, especially as some energy drinks are sold in larger cans (500ml) and can contain as much as 160mg of caffeine per serving.
