Sadly the owners seem to think this is acceptable behaviour.","state":"open","signature_count":17,"created_at":"2018-09-15T22:01:08.171Z","updated_at":"2018-11-05T00:13:55.339Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-09-24T13:16:00.402Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-09-16T19:30:37.605Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Anne Brown","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":228225,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/228225.json"},"attributes":{"action":"The British people should have a referendum on abolishing the Monarchy.","background":"The British people should be given a referendum to decide whether to keep the Monarchy or become a republic.","additional_details":"The British public should be given a vote to decide whether to keep the Monarchy or not.","state":"open","signature_count":17,"created_at":"2018-09-03T18:57:02.748Z","updated_at":"2018-11-08T11:39:26.687Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-09-27T15:35:43.385Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-09-21T17:20:05.276Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Jamie Davies","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":228030,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/228030.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Government to fund a rail/bus discount card for those in education until age 18.","background":"My friend's 16-year-old daughter is starting college this year and will need to travel by train and as there is no other alternative she has had to purchase an adult season ticket at huge expense.","additional_details":"As all children are expected to remain in education until the age of 18 it is unfair that their parents should have to pay full adult rail and bus fares for them.\r\n\r\nBecause our train and bus companies are all privately owned it is very difficult to ask them to change their policies, however, I do believe that the Government has a duty of care to all students and those undertaking low paid apprenticeships and I would like to ask Government to consider funding a student/young persons rail/bus discount card thereby helping to reduce travelling costs for parents.","state":"open","signature_count":17,"created_at":"2018-08-30T10:50:53.340Z","updated_at":"2018-11-15T07:41:49.213Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-09-05T13:17:08.160Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-08-30T13:54:26.677Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Karen Dow","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":227999,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/227999.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Educate children and teenagers about Learning Disabilities and Mental Health","background":"1 in 4 people will have a mental health illness. 1 in 50 people have a learning disability.
