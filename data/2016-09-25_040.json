The guidance (GMC, NICE and BMA) does not state that the private consultant had to be NHS, just qualified.","state":"open","signature_count":20,"created_at":"2016-05-28T16:40:20.890Z","updated_at":"2016-09-14T00:34:55.686Z","open_at":"2016-06-03T15:16:48.410Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2016-05-28T18:05:11.122Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"creator_name":"Stephen Mckellar","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":131324,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/131324.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Place more stringent requirements on school meals that are served at break.","background":"Currently, at our school, the main meals are healthy, the menu varies and the quality of the produce is high, but as not all of the standards on health, quality and variety apply to break food, the same things are served every day.
