The majority of these thefts is by teenagers with learner plates; who require no experience or background checks before being able to ride. We propose that all people wishing to obtain a moped require a full license.","state":"open","signature_count":33,"created_at":"2018-01-30T12:53:57.678Z","updated_at":"2018-02-11T10:53:41.462Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-02-05T17:02:48.999Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-01-30T13:48:18.932Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"David Wong","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":210513,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/210513.json"},"attributes":{"action":"We demand that the Govt. takes immediate action to solve the NHS crisis.","background":"1.
