This represents a 100% increase in an 18 month period. These increases have and will continue to negatively affect charities who have already suffered in the last few years from reduced income while seeing an increase in the demand for their services.\r\n","state":"open","signature_count":1528,"created_at":"2016-12-19T17:15:34.209Z","updated_at":"2017-03-25T14:30:18.994Z","open_at":"2016-12-21T17:19:52.513Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2016-12-19T21:42:24.163Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"creator_name":"Simon Jonathan Hickman","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":177815,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/177815.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Remove the tax on child support for victims of domestic violence.","background":"The 4 per cent Child Maintenance Service (CMS) collection fee presents real difficulties, particularly for domestic abuse victims.\r\n\r\nFor victims, a family-based arrangement is mostly impossible to arrange and using the CMS may be the only safe way for victims of domestic abuse to claim support.\r\n","additional_details":"We are calling on the UK Government to protect, not punish victims of domestic violence by removing the 4% collection charge for victim-survivors.\r\n\r\nMore background information here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/child-maintenance-service-single-mother-dwp-snp-child-support-agency-a7505746.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/theresa-urged-abolish-cruel-domestic-9446041\r\n\r\nhttp://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/14961377.Charge_is____cruel____tax_on_abuse_survivors/\r\n\r\n","state":"open","signature_count":1526,"created_at":"2017-01-18T12:02:40.746Z","updated_at":"2017-03-25T19:43:35.581Z","open_at":"2017-01-20T17:45:51.584Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-01-18T15:33:23.900Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"creator_name":"David Russell","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":177916,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/177916.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Guarantee rights of all EU citizens in UK as condition of Art 50 notice","background":"\r\nIf the UK claims to open to the world, it needs to lead by example. \r\n\r\nIt is the right thing to do morally and will create goodwill with the EU/other Member States.
