Most councils have made concessions for disabled drivers to park free of charge on/off street, however it seems that privately operated car parks (which are most retail parks and supermarkets) are being allowed to waiver the concession rights of disabled drivers. I want this to change so that disabled concession of free parking applies to all on/off street parking.
