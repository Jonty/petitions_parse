However, the Government does take seriously the concerns shared about NHS Trusts allowing commercial representatives to approach new mothers in maternity wards shortly after they have given birth. New parents have a right to dignity and to feel safe and comfortable on NHS wards. This is particularly true for women in the period after giving birth when they may feel especially vulnerable.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) maternity inspection framework was updated to include lines of enquiry about the processes that Trusts have in place regarding the access of commercial representatives on postnatal wards. It is for individual trusts to make decisions about allowing commercial representatives access to postnatal wards.  However, as with all hospital visitors, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) expects trusts to have robust procedures in place to ensure that all representatives respect the privacy and dignity of all women and their families. \r\n\r\nAny commercial representatives speaking to patients within an NHS ward should provide clear information about how patient data will be used and ensure that they are operating in compliance of the Data Protection Act 2018. This is a matter for each individual Trust to consider, in line with their local practices.  Over the last year DHSC has been working alongside system partners within a National General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) Working Group to develop a comprehensive suite of guidance products to help organisations recognise their obligations, and put effective governance and risk management arrangements in place across health and social care. These are published on the NHS Digital website on a dedicated GDPR portal. This website can be accessed via the following link: \r\nhttps://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/looking-after-information/data-security-and-information-governance/information-governance-alliance-iga/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-guidance. \r\n\r\nIt is for individual organisations to take account of these guidance products when developing their own policies and risk management practices.\r\n\r\nIpswich hospital has introduced a system where mothers are only approached by a commercial representative if they indicate that this is something that they would like. Mothers can show their preference by placing a card on their bedside table. This is a good example of how Trusts can put processes in place to give new mothers clear control over their interaction with commercial representatives. The Government is considering how to clarify guidance, so that that the interaction between commercial representatives and new mothers on NHS wards is consistently more positive across the UK.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-25T16:10:22.616Z","updated_at":"2018-10-25T16:10:22.616Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":219758,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/219758.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Ban the sale of products containing unsustainably sourced palm oil in the UK","background":"Global production of and demand for palm oil is increasing rapidly.

A huntsman will go out ahead of the field and lay a trail; the dogs and followers will then follow this trail. Because the huntsmen or followers do not know in advance the route hounds will take when following the trail, trail hunting tends to closely match traditional live quarry hunting.\r\n\r\nIt is for the Forestry Commission to decide whether to permit trail hunting on its land.\r\n  \r\nThe Forestry Commission only permits trail hunting on the Public Forest Estate (PFE) to members of the Masters of Fox Hounds Association (MFHA) and the Masters of Draghounds and Bloodhounds Association (MDBA). The Forestry Commission enters into master agreements with the MFHA and MDBA, which strictly govern the terms under which trail and drag hunting are permitted on the PFE.\r\n\r\nThe agreements oblige each hunt to obtain a separate permission from the Forest Management Director of the District to trail and drag hunt on the PFE and to agree dates and routes four weeks prior to the commencement of the season in November.\r\n\r\nThe permission obliges the hunt to maintain £5 million liability insurance and indemnify the Forestry Commission against any damage or loss. The permission also strictly enforces the byelaws of the Forestry Commission and gives the Forest Management Director the ability to restrict the number of hounds and manner of hunting.\r\n\r\nThe Head of Estates meets the MFHA annually to review the previous season’s activity and to report on any issues and agree any actions that need to be taken.

The SEND system introduced through the Children and Families Act 2014 is aimed at identifying and meeting a range of diverse needs. Schools should be monitoring the progress of all their pupils and intervening where learning difficulties are identified, providing ‎the 'graduated approach' known as SEN support. This is a cycle of assessment, planning, intervention and review used by schools and colleges to assist them to identify needs and continuously support progress. Schools and colleges are required to use their best endeavours to support children and young people’s needs. \r\n\r\nWhere this approach is applied in a timely and effective way, the majority of children and young people with autism can and do achieve well in their education without an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plan. In January 2018 14.6% of the school population were identified with SEN and just 2.9% of these had an EHC plan. \r\n\r\nIf a child or young person, including those with autism, does not make expected progress in response to the support being provided by the school, or the support required exceeds the school or colleges’ SEND provision, the school or college, or the parents/carers of the child or young person, or the young person themselves, can ask the local authority to carry out an EHC needs assessment, provided one has not taken place in the previous six months. All local authorities have a duty under the Children and Families Act 2014 to carry out assessments and draw up EHC plans where necessary and they must look at each request for an assessment individually. \r\n\r\nMany children and young people with autism do have an EHC plan. 28.2% of all the pupils with EHC plans in January 2018 had autism identified as their primary need, the most common type of need overall (School Census). Out of 119,909 pupils with a primary need of autism, 55% had an EHC plan (or statement) and 45% were on SEN support.  Identification of children with autism who need plans has increased each year since 2010. Children and young people with autism are being identified for EHC plans where necessary. \r\n\r\nChildren and young people with autism have especially benefitted from the person-centred, multi-agency, participative approach of the reformed SEND system and its focus on good progress and successful supported transition to adulthood. The system is based on meeting individuals’ needs rather than the creating mandatory categories of groups of children with SEND.  \r\n\r\nWe have funded the Autism Education Trust (AET) since 2011 to deliver autism awareness and autism training to education staff in early years, schools and further education settings and it has so far reached more than 190,000 people - not just teachers and teaching assistants, but also support staff such as receptionists, dining hall staff and caretakers, encouraging a ‘whole school’ approach to supporting pupils with autism.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education","created_at":"2018-10-30T09:36:02.329Z","updated_at":"2018-10-30T09:36:02.329Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":230451,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/230451.json"},"attributes":{"action":"UK government to integrate all rights in UN CEDAW Convention into domestic law.","background":"In 1986 the UK government ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).

One of the key priorities in this framework is to prevent deaths from respiratory diseases.\r\n\r\nThe Government has also announced a new five-year funding settlement for the NHS, which will see an increase of £20.5 billion in real terms by 2023-24. NHS leaders are currently developing a long-term plan, to be published at the end of this year, which will underpin this settlement. No decisions have been made yet over the share of funds to be allocated to lung diseases, however NHS England has highlighted respiratory healthcare as one of its main priorities to be included in the plan.\r\n\r\nPulmonary fibrosis (PF) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are incurable types of interstitial lung disease (ILD) for which there are few treatment options. NHS England publishes a service specification for ILDs to encourage clinicians to refer patients to their nearest ILD centre for the appropriate investigations and treatment. \r\n\r\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) also publishes guidelines and quality standards for IPF to help healthcare professionals diagnose the condition and provide effective treatment. There are only two licenced disease-modifying drugs available for IPF – pirfenidone and nintedanib. Both of these drugs are approved by NICE and are prescribed by the ILD centres. \r\n\r\nOther types of treatment such as rehabilitation, nursing support, home oxygen, and palliative care, are set out in the ILD service specification to make clear the standards of care expected from NHS providers. \r\n\r\nNHS England also funds the Respiratory Futures programme hosted by the British Thoracic Society (BTS).
