Soon they will push to ban all guns, so we must make the first move to prevent this.","state":"open","signature_count":1670,"created_at":"2016-05-15T17:20:40.565Z","updated_at":"2016-08-26T11:01:15.164Z","open_at":"2016-05-16T09:43:49.799Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2016-05-15T18:07:37.046Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"creator_name":"George Jackson","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":125510,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/125510.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Reconsider debating ignored petition on Jeremy Hunt signed by 330k","background":"The petitions committee recently chose not to debate a petition signed by almost 330,000 who have no trust in Jeremy Hunt as Health Secretary.
