These increases have and will continue to negatively affect charities who have already suffered in the last few years from reduced income while seeing an increase in the demand for their services.","state":"open","signature_count":9,"created_at":"2017-12-13T17:53:53.380Z","updated_at":"2018-03-15T10:38:55.879Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-12-18T18:10:03.793Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-12-14T08:01:34.380Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Simon Hickman","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":207599,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/207599.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Offset any rise in the price of fuel","background":"As Christmas is approaching, I would like to propose that if the price of a litre of fuel is to rise by 3p then the government should reduce the amount of tax on fuel by the very same amount.
