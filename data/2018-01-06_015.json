The UK should impose embargo on the nation until democracy has been restored.","state":"open","signature_count":42,"created_at":"2017-09-18T19:56:37.141Z","updated_at":"2017-12-24T20:23:27.166Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-09-19T16:32:06.216Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-09-18T20:31:38.781Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Maurizio Cuttin","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":200555,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200555.json"},"attributes":{"action":"HGVs to be restricted to the slow lane only on motorways and dual carriageways","background":"Due to the increase in serious road traffic accidents cause by HGVs we would like to see HGVs restricted to the slow lane on motorways and dual carriageways","additional_details":"","state":"open","signature_count":42,"created_at":"2017-09-16T19:36:20.455Z","updated_at":"2017-12-24T20:24:22.361Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-09-18T13:58:01.056Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-09-16T20:38:53.857Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Vanessa Turpin","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":207735,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/207735.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make it a legal requirement for local councils to scan deceased domestic animals","background":"Make it a legal requirement for local councils to scan deceased domestic animals for chips and report to local vet to alert owners, to ensure people are aware their pet has passed away and don’t continue looking, also to raise awareness of potential animal abuse in certain boroughs","additional_details":"Local council are collecting cats and dogs found and just disposing of them with other waste without any form of logging system this leads to people often looking for pets months and even years putting up flyers for animals they have no hope of finding.
