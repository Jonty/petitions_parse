The Prime Minister has called modern slavery one of the ‘greatest human rights issues of our time’, and made clear that the international community must step up our efforts to eradicate it.  It is not acceptable that such exploitation is occurring in the 21st Century. \r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister launched a Call to Action to end modern slavery at this year’s UN General Assembly alongside 40 other countries, and committed to doubling UK aid spend in support of this objective to £150 million. We will continue to push for an increased international response, through the UN and other channels, to eliminate these horrific crimes, provide support for victims, and bring criminals to justice. In particular, we are pushing for the United Nations Security Council to take greater steps to combat slavery in conflict situations. \r\n\r\nThe UK Government shares others’ disgust and grave concern at the recent video footage apparently showing slave markets in Libya.  We welcome the Libyan government’s commitment immediately to investigate these reports and to ensure that those involved are brought to justice.   In addition, the UK has raised with the Libyan Prime Minister the importance of offering humanitarian support to migrants.  \r\n\r\nWe have consistently argued for a comprehensive approach, addressing the root causes of migration as well as their consequences.  In addition to the UK’s £150 million commitment on modern slavery, UK programmes have provided humanitarian aid to migrants and refugees, and delivered assistance in detention centres and to those rescued at sea.  We have provided specific support to women and girls, to protect them from the heightened risks of trafficking and sexual and gender based violence.  So far this year, the Department for International Development has supported more than 20,000 emergency interventions such as healthcare, funding psychosocial support, hygiene kits and safe shelter to migrants and refugees in Libya.\r\n\r\nWe have also developed a new £75m migration programme, which will specifically target migrants travelling from West Africa via the Sahel to Libya.  It will provide critical humanitarian assistance and protection and assist those along the way that may wish to return home, providing information about the dangers ahead and offering vulnerable people meaningful alternatives to the treacherous journeys to Libya and Europe.  \r\n\r\nAt the United Nations General Assembly in September, the Prime Minister committed to increasing efforts to tackle smuggling and trafficking through building the capacity of Libyan law enforcement agencies, and supporting efforts to sanction people smugglers at the UN.  \r\n\r\nThe UK has made clear at the United Nations Security Council our condemnation of these reports, and we support the recent Declaration from the EU-Africa Summit and the establishment of an EU-AU-UN Taskforce to address this dire situation to help returns.  UK programming has enabled the assisted voluntary return of over 1,400 migrants from Libya to their home countries this year, and we support further efforts in this area, including by the European Union Emergency Trust Fund for Africa.\r\n\r\nWe are clear that a sustainable improvement in the human rights situation in Libya can only be achieved under the stability of a strong and united Government, and we are actively supporting UN-led efforts to deliver a more inclusive political settlement in Libya.  As well as our support for peace mediation and stability we are providing support to improve women’s rights, civil society, municipalities, and freedom of speech.  A safe, secure and prosperous Libya that is able confidently to tackle the challenges in the region is in all our interests.\r\n\r\nThe Government looks forward to responding with fuller details on this very important issue in the forthcoming Westminster Hall Debate on Monday 18 December.\r\n\r\nForeign and Commonwealth Office","created_at":"2017-12-13T10:52:14.144Z","updated_at":"2017-12-13T10:52:14.144Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":"2017-12-18","transcript_url":"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2017-12-18/debates/D4D9004C-0D4E-4DAD-8C98-309E2C42D2E1/EnslavementOfBlackAfricans(Libya)","video_url":"http://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/71772c45-c2ba-400a-a9f3-7bcdd9400907","debate_pack_url":"http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CDP-2017-0259","overview":""}}},{"type":"petition","id":205106,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/205106.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Stop the privatisation of NHS services","background":"We call for a ban on the outsourcing (privatisation) of NHS services, and stop the renewal of any outsourcing contracts already signed.

Therefore the Government considers that a public inquiry into this tragic case is not necessary.","details":"The murder of Jamie Bulger was an appalling crime which shocked the nation and, 25 years on, continues to be of huge interest and concern. Our deepest sympathies remain with Mrs Fergus and Mr Bulger for the pain and suffering they have endured. \r\n\r\nBecause this case has been of such understandable concern, when the man formerly known as Jon Venables was recalled to custody in February 2010, the then Justice Secretary asked Sir David Omand, the former Permanent Secretary at the Home Office, to conduct an extensive review of the management of Venables from the time of his release from Red Bank Secure Children’s Home in 2001 until his recall to custody. In July 2010 Venables was convicted of possessing, downloading and sharing indecent images of children, and Sir David’s detailed report was published in November 2010 and can be found at the following link: https://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/publications/corporate-reports/MoJ/2010/omand-review-web.pdf \r\n\r\nThe independent Parole Board directed Venables’ re-release on life licence – subject to strict licence conditions in July 2013 after a thorough risk assessment and in accordance with the statutory release test, which is whether it is necessary on the grounds of public protection for the offender to be detained in custody. The Parole Board is legally not allowed to share the reasons behind any of its release decisions, but the Government last month announced an urgent review into how to increase the transparency of Parole-Board decision-making and whether and how it might be possible to challenge those decisions.\r\n\r\nUnlike in 2010, Jon Venables’ recent criminal acts were discovered as a direct result of the tight monitoring to which he was subject by the Police and Probation Services. He has also constantly been subject to stricter licence conditions and more scrutiny than most lifers would be at the same stage of their sentence. For that reason, a review of the management of Venables since 2010 would not have the same clear focus. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, the Government’s number one priority is public safety so we will of course keep the monitoring practice under constant review. Venables is now serving a sentence of 40 months’ imprisonment for possessing indecent images of children. Once he has completed the custodial part of that sentence, he will remain in custody until the independent Parole Board determines that his risk is such that he may be re-released on life licence.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Justice","created_at":"2018-02-14T14:06:36.907Z","updated_at":"2018-02-14T14:06:36.907Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":206722,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/206722.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Call on PM to take action to build public trust in the Grenfell Tower Inquiry","background":"Bereaved families \u0026 survivors call on PM to exercise her powers under the Inquiries Act 2005 to appoint additional panel members with decision making power to sit alongside Chair in Grenfell Tower Inquiry: to ensure those affected have confidence in \u0026 are willing to fully participate in the Inquiry","additional_details":"To secure trust in an establishment we feel has been distant \u0026 unresponsive, \u0026 to avoid a collapse of confidence in the Inquiry's ability to discover the truth, it is fundamental that;\r\n\r\n1.

Section 7 of the Inquiries Act 2005 allows the Minister responsible for an inquiry to appoint further panel members during the course of an inquiry with the agreement of the Chair.\r\n\r\nIn October 2017, the Chair announced the appointment of 7 expert witnesses with backgrounds in fire safety, forensic fire analysis, fire engineering, disaster resilience and also anatomy and human identification. The expert witnesses will provide a range of technical advice and expert reports to assist the work of the Inquiry in delivering its terms of reference.\r\n\r\nIn addition, in November 2017, the Chair announced the appointment of 3 assessors with backgrounds in community engagement and social housing, local authority administration and structural engineering.  The Chair also confirmed at the Inquiry’s preliminary hearing in September that he would expect the assessors to see all the evidence and sit with him when taking oral evidence. The Chair has also confirmed that he may make further appointments if needed.\r\nFollowing the announcement of these appointments, the Prime Minister carefully considered the composition of the Inquiry panel in light of the diversity and expertise of advice now available to the Inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister wrote to the representatives of the survivors and bereaved families on 21 December 2017 and informed them of her decision not to appoint additional panel members. The Prime Minister’s decision was similarly communicated to the Inquiry on the same date.\r\n\r\nHaving regard to the terms of reference and the assistance to be provided by the assessors, and the expert witnesses, it is the Prime Minister’s view that the Inquiry panel has the necessary expertise to undertake the Inquiry as it is currently constituted. The Prime Minister is also conscious of the need for the Inquiry to complete its initial report as quickly as reasonably possible. The Prime Minister therefore considers that additional panel members should not be appointed at this stage.\r\n\r\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Prime Minister fully took into account her duty under section 149 of the Equality Act 2010 (the Public Sector Equality Duty – PSED).\r\n\r\nThe Government recognises the importance of ensuring that those most affected by the tragedy are able to contribute fully to the Inquiry and that is why the Prime Minister welcomes the consideration being given by Sir Martin Moore-Bick to the establishment of a community advisory panel, as proposed at the December procedural hearing.\r\n\r\nSuch a panel, similar to that which has worked well for the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, could play a very beneficial role in putting those most affected at the heart of the Inquiry and enabling them to ensure that their views and experiences are heard. It is for Sir Martin, as Chair of the independent Inquiry, to take this forward, in consultation with the Grenfell Tower community, and the Government hopes that he will be able to do this as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nIn line with the Inquiry Rules 2006, legal representatives of the Grenfell community core participants will receive in advance of hearings disclosure of relevant evidence; will be able to make opening and closing statements at certain hearings and can suggest lines of questioning to be pursued by Counsel to the Inquiry. They can also apply to the Chair to ask questions of a witness.\r\n\r\nCabinet Office","created_at":"2018-01-05T10:15:21.002Z","updated_at":"2018-02-08T09:53:33.016Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":209455,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/209455.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make Orkambi available on the NHS for people with Cystic Fibrosis","background":"Conventional CF treatments target the symptoms of CF, precision medicines like Orkambi tackle the cause of the condition.

NICE’s appraisal committee concluded that while Orkambi was clinically effective and important for managing cystic fibrosis, the benefits were not sufficient to justify its considerable cost. Officials from NHS England engaged with Vertex (the manufacturer) to explore proposals to secure a pricing structure that would enable a positive recommendation from NICE – however, Vertex was unable to come forward with a viable model that would enable the drug to be funded. \r\n \r\nNICE periodically reviews its guidance to determine whether there is significant new evidence that might affect its recommendations.

Although a small minority of people use fireworks in a dangerous, inconsiderate or anti-social manner, we believe that the majority use them sensibly and responsibly.\r\n\r\nThe Government is aware of concerns about the distress noisy fireworks can cause to individuals, as well as to livestock, pets and wildlife. Therefore, the Government urges those using fireworks to be considerate to their neighbours and give sufficient notice of firework use, particularly to those who are vulnerable such as older people, children, those with mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and those with pets and livestock. We have worked with the fireworks industry to encourage users of fireworks to give notice of their displays so that those who are vulnerable or keep animals can make arrangements for their safety.  \r\n\r\nThe Blue Cross animal charity has also produced information on animals and fireworks, which gives advice on how to avoid or reduce stress to animals when fireworks are being set off.  The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) and the Kennel Club provide similar advice on their websites concerning how to minimise the impact of fireworks use on animals.\r\nThere is already a ban on the general public from purchasing fireworks with higher levels of risk and noise and seasonal limitations on their sale. The Fireworks Regulations 2004 restrict their sale to the traditional fireworks periods around 5th November, Diwali, New Year’s Eve and the Chinese New Year. These are an important part of British tradition reflecting our history and multi-culturalism. While it is possible to buy fireworks at other times of the year, a ‘licence to sell fireworks’ is required and strict conditions are imposed outside the traditional periods. \r\n\r\nAt present any firework that exceeds 120 decibels must not be supplied to consumers. There are also low noise fireworks available that consumers can choose to buy, but we do not propose to bring in regulations to require all fireworks to be low noise. \r\n\r\nGovernment acknowledges that many people have genuine concerns about the use and, the misuse, of fireworks and the risks of firework-related injury. However, the number of injuries is low and the total number of hospital admissions caused by firework injuries has remained below 200 a year for the last 10 years. \r\n\r\nThe Government does not plan to make any changes to the way statistics relating to enforcement actions are collected. The Government believes the focus of enforcement should be on delivering necessary protections and on working with businesses, citizens and others to ensure safety.\r\n\r\nThe Government believes that the current regulations strike the right balance between the enjoyment of fireworks by the public and restricting the sale and use of fireworks for public safety reasons. \r\n\r\nThe best way to continue to reduce the distress caused by fireworks is to work with industry, retailers and others to promote the safe and responsible use of fireworks through guidance and public education and to ensure that appropriate action is taken against those that break the rules. \r\n\r\nThe obligations for the Secretary of State referred to in the e-petition, to publish a regulatory Impact Assessment and to consult interested organisations, only apply when making new regulations and we have no plans to change the legislation relating to fireworks.\r\n\r\nAs set out above, given there is already legislation in place which controls the sale and use and misuse of fireworks; we have no plans to extend this further.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-27T14:39:35.017Z","updated_at":"2017-10-27T14:39:35.017Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":"2018-01-29","transcript_url":"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2018-01-29/debates/913A2227-7B51-44CD-870A-56C0A5ACAC73/Fireworks","video_url":"http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/2a1e3167-13f1-4dcc-9297-6a51f3854ac3","debate_pack_url":"","overview":""}}},{"type":"petition","id":205169,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/205169.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Parliament's vote on the Brexit deal must include an option to remain in the EU.","background":"A lesser of two evils choice between a bad deal and no deal is not acceptable.

","details":"The UK welcomes genuine visitors to the UK. The visitor route offers a huge range of activities that can be undertaken whilst a person is in the UK, including spending time with family. \r\n\r\nEvery visitor is assessed against the same Immigration Rules regardless of nationality. The only difference is where that assessment is made. Some individuals are assessed overseas by an entry clearance officer, while others are assessed at the UK border. All visitors to the UK are assessed against the Immigration Rules on a case by case basis.\r\n\r\nNationals of some non-EEA countries need a visa to visit the UK. Visas are an important part of securing the UK’s border and are an effective tool for the UK in reducing illegal immigration, tackling organised crime and protecting national security. \r\n\r\nAppendix V to the Immigration Rules sets out the requirements that a person seeking entry to the UK as a visitor must meet. This includes that a visitor must satisfy the decision maker that they are a genuine visitor who intends to leave the UK at the end of their visit and will not live in the UK for extended periods through frequent or successive visits, or make the UK their own home. They must be able to show that they are able to accommodate, support and maintain themselves during their visit without working or accessing public funds. There is flexibility in the rules for visitors to be maintained and accommodated by friends or relatives. \r\n\r\nAutomatically approving visas for a select group of people would mean that important considerations against the Immigration Rules would not be applied consistently and could raise equality concerns. It could lead to discrimination against those who do not have family members in the UK but have just as valid a reason for wishing to visit the UK.\r\n\r\nThere is also a danger of additional complexity in the assessment process around how an individual would prove that they are the family member of a British citizen. There could be unintended consequences that make the application process longer, more difficult and costly.\r\n\r\nThe Government recognises the importance of family ties. In 2015 we simplified the immigration system for people visiting the UK by consolidating the number of visitor routes from fifteen to four and providing shortened, user-friendly Immigration Rules and guidance to make the requirements easier to understand. The changes created an easier-to-use, streamlined system with more flexibility for those visiting the UK over what they can do when they are in the UK. \r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2018-01-22T16:46:53.272Z","updated_at":"2018-01-22T16:46:53.272Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":204098,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/204098.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Stop the Common Fisheries Policy being adopted into UK law post-Brexit.","background":"We call on the Government to make the fishing industry a stand-alone entity, outside of the 'Great Repeal Bill,' after revelations that 'technical measures' of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) will be adopted into UK law on our leaving the EU.","additional_details":"On the UK's withdrawal from the EU, Britain can leave the CFP and reclaim its 200-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) under international law (UNCLOS).\r\n\r\nAdopting UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) would allow total UK control over access; the setting of quota; fisheries management, and fishing systems; rather than blindly following the terms dictated to us by Brussels. \r\n\r\nHowever, adopting the CFP into UK law for transitional purposes not only allows continued access for EU vessels into UK waters but also opens the possibility for the EU taking legal action, claiming, 'continuity of rights.'\r\n\r\nTherefore, if we are to have a fishing industry post-Brexit, keeping the terms of the CFP in place is not an option!","state":"open","signature_count":61152,"created_at":"2017-10-31T13:10:26.433Z","updated_at":"2018-04-04T23:31:50.533Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-11-03T17:05:35.694Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-10-31T13:35:18.798Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2017-11-08T23:42:31.271Z","government_response_at":"2017-11-21T12:29:41.820Z","debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Michael Hookem MEP","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"When the UK leaves the EU, we will no longer be bound by the Common Fisheries Policy.","details":"As an independent Coastal State, we will regain our rights to manage our fisheries in accordance with our rights under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and have control of our Exclusive Economic Zone (out to 200 nautical miles or the median line with other states).

The Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2016 (TSRGD) sets out the design and conditions of use for traffic signs that may be used on roads in England, Scotland and Wales. \r\n\r\nTraffic signs use symbols which enable drivers to take in the information quickly and understand the meaning of the sign. Symbols are often internationally recognised which is important for all road users, especially those who may be unfamiliar to the area. \r\n\r\nIn the case of a directional sign to a leisure facility (such as a football ground), the symbols used are a general representation of the activity being depicted. As such, drivers can then quickly understand the type of destination. The football ground symbol first appeared in TSRGD in 1994 and road users have become accustomed to its use.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of traffic signs is to “convey warnings, information, requirements, restrictions or prohibitions” (Section 64 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984). \r\nThe Department for Transport commissioned research into road user’s understanding of traffic signs in 2011. This concluded that respondents “showed a good basic level of understanding as to what different types of sign meant” and recommended that signs should be kept simple.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of a traffic sign is not to raise public appreciation and awareness of geometry which is better dealt with in other ways. If the correct geometry were put onto a sign, it would only be visible close up and not from the distance at which drivers will see the sign. The detail of the geometry would also not be taken in by most drivers who were merely looking at the sign for direction. The higher level of attention needed to understand the geometry could distract a driver’s view away from the road for longer than necessary which could therefore increase the risk of an incident.\r\n\r\nAdditionally the public funding required to change every football sign nationally would place an unreasonable financial burden on local authorities.

The Government currently has no plans to make changes to the law.\r\n","details":"This Government has committed to halving rough sleeping by 2022 and eliminating it altogether by 2027.  To achieve this, we have established a Rough Sleeping and Homelessness Reduction Taskforce who, with the support of an expert Advisory Panel, will drive forward the implementation of a cross-Government strategy. Enforcement can form part of moving someone away from the streets but it should also come with an offer of meaningful support.  In developing the strategy, the Taskforce and Advisory Panel will consider a range of measures to support rough sleepers off the streets, including enforcement measures where appropriate.\r\n\r\nUnder sections 3 and 4 of the Vagrancy Act 1824, begging and persistent begging in a public place are arrestable offences.  They are also recordable offences which enables the police to identify repeat offenders. Decisions on arrests are an operational matter for the police, in line with their duties to keep the peace, to protect communities, and to prevent the commission of offences, working within the provisions of the legal framework set by Parliament (or, as appropriate, the common law).\r\n\r\nIt is an operational decision for the police following advice from the Crown Prosecution Service, whether or not an offence reaches the threshold required for prosecution under the relevant legislation.\r\n\r\nIf any person whilst begging uses threatening or abusive words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour, within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby then they could be prosecuted for an offence under the Public Order Act 1986 and if convicted are liable to be fined.  There are also a range of offences under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 which are available if violence is used by a beggar.\r\n\r\nThe Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 introduced Public Spaces Protection Orders (PSPO) which place restrictions or impose conditions on activities that people may carry out in a designated area.  These replaced the use of Anti-social Behaviour Orders.  PSPOs should not be used to target people based solely on the fact that someone is homeless or rough sleeping, as this in itself is unlikely to mean that such behaviour is having an unreasonably detrimental effect on the community’s quality of life which justifies the restrictions imposed.  Councils may receive complaints about homeless people, but they should consider whether the use of a PSPO is the appropriate response.  These Orders should be used only to address any specific behaviour that is causing a detrimental effect on the community’s quality of life which is beyond the control of the person concerned. \r\n \r\nCouncils should therefore consider carefully the nature of any potential PSPO that may impact on homeless people and rough sleepers.  It is recommended that any Order defines precisely the specific activity or behaviour that is having the detrimental impact on the community.  Councils should also consider measures that tackle the root causes of the behaviour, such as the provision of public toilets. \r\n \r\nThe council should also consider consulting with national or local homeless charities when considering restrictions or requirements which may impact on homeless people and rough sleepers.\r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2018-02-01T10:05:25.323Z","updated_at":"2018-02-01T10:05:25.323Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":204631,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/204631.json"},"attributes":{"action":"The Government must publish their consultation on social care by early 2018.","background":"A chronic lack of funding means that over 1 million older and disabled people are going without the care they need, including help to get out of bed, wash and eat - without this basic help they cannot live a decent life.","additional_details":"Pledges to fix the care system have been repeatedly pushed aside by governments for the last 20 years, whilst people go on struggling to find care for their loved ones.

Our vision for care must also incorporate the wider networks of support and services which help older people to live independently, including the crucial role of housing and the interaction with other public services.  It must consider how care is provided at present and challenge the system to embrace new technology, innovation and workforce models which can deliver better quality and value.\r\n\r\nTo deliver a lasting solution, it is right that we take the time needed to debate these complex issues and listen to a range of perspectives to build consensus.  For this reason, over the coming months, we will work with experts, stakeholders, people using care and support services, and carers to shape the long-term reform which is urgently needed.  The Government has already established an Inter-Ministerial Group to oversee development of the Green Paper, and as part of this initial engagement we have asked a number of independent experts in this area to provide their views to the group.  The Government will also engage closely with representatives from local government, the NHS, the voluntary sector and care providers, as well as with people who use care and support and carers, to underpin development of the Green Paper.  And when the Green Paper is published, it will then be subject to a full public consultation, providing a further opportunity for interested parties to give their views.\r\n\r\nWhilst the Green Paper will focus on care for older people, the Government recognises both the challenges faced by people of working age with care needs and the many common questions about the sustainability of the care system.  Many of the discussions on the Green Paper reforms will impact on care and support for adults of all ages.  However, to ensure that issues for working-age adults with care needs are considered in their own right, the Government will take forward a parallel programme of work, led jointly by the Department of Health and the Department for Communities and Local Government, which will focus on this group.  This work will also be overseen by the Inter-Ministerial Group to ensure alignment with the Green Paper.\r\n\r\nThe Green Paper presents a unique opportunity to build consensus around reforms which can last. There is no escaping that building a sustainable care and support system will require choices about what that system should provide and how it is paid for.  But getting this right promises a better system that everyone can have confidence in, where people understand their responsibilities, can prepare for the future, and know that the care they receive will be to a high standard and help them maintain their independence and wellbeing.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2017-11-24T14:46:39.794Z","updated_at":"2017-11-24T14:46:39.794Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":203692,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/203692.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Teach black history In History lessons","background":"Introduce black history into primary and secondary schools","additional_details":"Black history is only taught in some schools and only as and when teachers feel it may be necessary.\r\nWe are asking the goverment to look at this closely to make black history become a part of history studies throughout the year.\r\nAlso looking at ways to have black history as part of GCSE options in secondary schools.","state":"open","signature_count":19496,"created_at":"2017-10-25T15:04:37.622Z","updated_at":"2018-04-04T20:39:25.656Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-11-01T17:54:31.700Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-10-27T14:46:11.351Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2017-11-09T09:58:40.175Z","government_response_at":"2017-11-23T17:48:06.449Z","debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"stephanie pitter","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"The national curriculum gives examples of black history topics, which schools may teach at each key stage.

A patient with a disability is not discriminated against should they require a transplant, they are assessed in the same way as any other potential recipient.\r\n\r\nAll patients undergo careful assessment before being placed onto the transplant waiting list. This assessment is divided into three main questions. First, whether a patient needs a transplant or whether another more effective treatment is available. Secondly the patient’s fitness is assessed to confirm whether they are well enough to receive a transplant. A transplant operation and the associated treatment that is required to make the transplant work is reasonably risky. Sometimes the patient needs extra procedures or medication before a transplant is even possible. Sadly, some people are just not fit enough to have this life saving or life enhancing operation. Thirdly there is an assessment of whether the patient is going to be able to care for themselves (and the transplant organ) after the transplant. This third stage is treated with particular care as the medical team will need to know whether the patient is able to look after their general health and take all the necessary medication in order to avoid rejection in the new transplant. \r\n\r\nWhen a patient with a learning disability is identified as being suitable for a transplant, the key factors are ensuring their consent can be obtained either directly or through their carer or representative and that they have the correct support during post-operative care. In most circumstances, the recipient’s family or carers will be very keen and supportive in giving all care that is needed after the transplant operation. Alternatively, if the patient does not have a carer, social services can often provide the support a person with a disability might need after undergoing a medical procedure. \r\n\r\nDuring the period after a patient has received a transplant, there will be a number of medications that the patient will need  to take. This includes immunosuppressants – drugs which make it much less likely that the new transplanted organ will be rejected. If a transplant recipient decides to discontinue the required post-operative medication, rejection of the organ is very likely to follow, which is why it is important that a patient receives the support they need.\r\n\r\nThere are a range of duties and supporting tools to ensure health professionals are able to support people with a learning disability. \r\n\r\nAll public bodies, including NHS organisations, must be proactive in eliminating unlawful discrimination and advancing equal opportunities, under the Equality Act. Since 1st August 2016 onwards, all organisations that provide NHS care or adult social care have been legally required to follow the Accessible Information Standard. The Standard aims to make sure that people who have a disability, impairment or sensory loss are provided with information that they can easily read and understand and with support so they can communicate effectively with health and social care services.\r\n\r\nThe Government has mandated Health Education England (HEE) to provide national leadership on education, training and workforce development in the NHS in England. Through the Mandate we will ensure that the NHS workforce is “is available in sufficient numbers and possesses the right skills, values and behaviours to deliver care and support for people with learning disabilities, autism, mental health problems and multiple and complex needs”’\r\n\r\nHEE e-Learning for Health have a programme dedicated to disability and the subject is also addressed as part of other e-learning programmes, such as those on the Accessible Information Standard, the Adolescent Health Course, Safeguarding Adults and Safeguarding Children.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Health and Social Care funded the development of Disability Matters, which was launched in February 2015, an e-learning tool providing training in understanding and supporting the needs and rights of people with a disability, developed in partnership with people with a disability and their families. https://www.disabilitymatters.org.uk/ It is a free resource for professionals in the NHS, social care and other settings who might work with people with a disability.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care","created_at":"2018-03-20T10:01:14.076Z","updated_at":"2018-03-20T10:01:14.076Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":213970,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/213970.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Require DEFRA to fund research into the cause/s of Alabama Rot (CRGV) in dogs","background":"Alabama Rot (CRGV) is a disease causing skin lesions, kidney failure and death in dogs.

The conflict has now lasted nearly seven years; over 400,000 people have been killed and half Syria’s population displaced. In recent weeks, the Asad regime’s brutal siege and bombardment of Eastern Ghouta has caused unprecedented levels of suffering.\r\n\r\nThe UK joined our close partners in mobilising support for the unanimous adoption of UN Security Council resolution 2401, which calls for a 30-day ceasefire in Syria to allow for delivery of humanitarian aid and medical evacuations, which are urgently needed across Syria, but particularly in Eastern Ghouta. We have consistently called on the regime and its backers Russia and Iran to cease their campaign of violence, to protect civilians and allow rapid and unhindered humanitarian access.\r\n\r\nThe UK has convened emergency discussions at the UN Security Council to press for implementation of the ceasefire; on Friday 2 March, the UN Human Rights Council held an urgent debate proposed by the UK, which adopted a resolution calling for full and immediate implementation of resolution 2401. \r\n\r\nOn 26 February, the Foreign Secretary and Lord Ahmed made statements to Parliament setting out the UK’s concerns in the strongest terms. The Foreign Secretary wrote to Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov on 27 February regarding the crisis in Eastern Ghouta urging Russia to uphold its commitments to ensure that UNSCR 2401 is implemented in full. On 27 February, Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, Sir Alan Duncan met Russian Ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, to stress UK concern at the current situation in Syria, particularly the crisis in Eastern Ghouta. Sir Alan Duncan urged Russia to use its influence to ensure the Syrian regime adhered to the ceasefire demanded by UN Security Council Resolution 2401. The Foreign Secretary released a statement on the 5 March directly calling for Russia and the Asad regime to fully implement UN Security Council resolution 2401.  \r\n\r\nThe UK continues to call upon all parties to the conflict to uphold International Humanitarian Law and protect civilians. We have used our position in the UN Security Council to draw attention to the systematic flouting of International Humanitarian Law and medical neutrality by the regime and its backers.

There are many legitimate, commercial reasons for people to do this and for businesses to engage them in this way. The off-payroll working rules, more commonly known as IR35, have been in place since 2000 to ensure that, where individuals would have been employees if they were providing their services directly, they pay broadly the same tax and National Insurance as other employees. It is fair that two individuals doing the same job in the same way pay broadly the same tax and National Insurance, even if one of them structures their work through a company.\r\n\r\nAs highlighted by reports from the Office of Tax Simplification and the House of Lords, it is clear that IR35 is not effective enough. To improve compliance, the Government introduced reforms in the public sector from April 2017. Individuals working through their own company in the public sector are no longer responsible for operating the off-payroll rules. Instead, where an individual’s company is directly engaged by a public sector body, the public sector body is responsible for determining whether or not the rules apply, and deducting any necessary employment taxes on payments to the individual’s company. Where this engagement takes place through an agency, the public sector body is responsible for determining whether or not the rules apply and informing the agency of this decision, in order that any necessary employment taxes can be deducted by the agency.\r\n\r\nThis is not a new tax on the self-employed. IR35 only applies to those who work like employees and would have been employed were they not working through a company. Genuinely self-employed individuals continue to be unaffected, as has been the case for over 15 years.\r\n\r\nThe Government is monitoring the impact of its reform of IR35 in the public sector. Initial evidence suggests that it has been successful in improving compliance. More people working through their own company are paying the right tax. However, the cost of non-compliance in the private sector is still growing and will cost taxpayers £1.2 billion a year by 2022/23. Therefore, a possible next step would be to extend these reforms to the private sector. \r\n\r\nTo take account of the needs of businesses and individuals who would implement any change, the Government will carefully consult on reform in the private sector, drawing on the experience of the public sector reforms, including through external research due to be published in the new year.\r\n\r\nHM Treasury","created_at":"2017-11-30T14:16:56.274Z","updated_at":"2017-11-30T14:16:56.274Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":205672,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/205672.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Don’t ban Grouse Shooting ","background":"Protect Grouse Shooting","additional_details":"Grouse moors and grouse shooting are integral and traditional parts of moorland management which benefit the grouse and ALL native wildlife i.e. Lapwing and plovers.

In January 2016 we published the Hen Harrier Action Plan to increase the English hen harrier population. It contains six actions that individually can bring benefits for hen harriers, but when combined underpin each other and have the potential to deliver positive outcomes. \r\n\r\nThe Action Plan was developed with senior representatives from organisations including Natural England, the Moorland Association, the National Gamekeepers’ Organisation, the Game \u0026 Wildlife Conservation Trust, National Parks England and formerly the RSPB. These organisations, led by Natural England, will monitor activities and report annually on progress to the Defra Uplands Stakeholder Forum and the UK Tasking and Co-ordinating group for Wildlife Crime.\r\n\r\nRaptors, like all wild birds, are afforded protection from illegal killing by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. However, the Government is concerned that there are still individuals who continue to commit these crimes. \r\n\r\nAs a result, the Government has identified the illegal persecution of raptors as a wildlife crime priority. Each wildlife crime priority has a delivery group to consider what action should be taken, and develop a plan to prevent crime, gather intelligence on offences and enforce against it. The Raptor Persecution Priority Delivery Group is made up of representatives from Government and non-government organisations working together to help preserve and protect the six UK priority raptor species (goshawk, red kite, golden eagle, hen harrier, peregrine falcon and white tailed eagle). \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the National Wildlife Crime Unit, which is part-funded by Defra, provides valuable intelligence and operational support to police forces in tackling wildlife crimes, including raptor persecution.

The use or threat of such action must be designed to influence the government or an international governmental organisation or to intimidate the public or a section of the public and be undertaken for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, racial or ideological cause.\r\n\r\nThe Government’s ‘Prevent’ strategy addresses all forms of terrorism, including that which is inspired by far left extremism. Preventing terrorism involves challenging extremist (and non-violent) ideas which are part of terrorist ideology.\r\n\r\nIn October 2015 we published the first ever Counter-Extremism Strategy to protect our communities from the wider social harms beyond terrorism caused by extremism. Extremists seek to justify behaviour that contradicts and undermines our shared values. If left unchallenged, the values that bind our society together start to fall apart. Women’s rights are eroded, intolerance and bigotry become normalised, minorities are targeted and communities become separated from the mainstream. Such behaviour cannot and will not go uncontested.\r\n\r\nThe Government is taking a comprehensive approach to tackling the evil ideology of extremism – whether violent or non-violent, Islamist, far-right or far-left.\r\n\r\nThe Counter-Extremism Strategy has four key pillars. We are: vigorously countering extremist ideology – making sure every part of government is taking action; actively supporting mainstream voices - especially in our faith communities and civil society; disrupting the most harmful extremists - using all of the tools available to us; and building more cohesive communities - by tackling segregation and feelings of alienation which can provide fertile ground for extremists’ messages. \r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2018-03-26T15:22:01.652Z","updated_at":"2018-03-26T15:22:01.652Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":204079,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/204079.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Ban Isis fighters from returning to the UK","background":"Anybody who has left this country to join ISIS should not be allowed to return.","additional_details":"We the people of the UK have a right to live safely without fear of Isis fighters returning to attack us.

It has taken steps to manage tyres on public service vehicles and initiated research. Extra measures are not ruled out.","details":"The Government takes road safety very seriously and has taken action to control the use of older tyres on public service vehicles (PSV) in response to the tragic event on the A3 in September 2012. The Government is committed to using robust evidence to guide policy decisions and further measures are not ruled out.\r\n\r\nConsultations with experts from the UK and EU tyre industry revealed that tyre ageing is more complex than a simple relationship with chronological age and is related to wider issues such as tyre use and maintenance. \r\n\r\nIn seeking scientific evidence to inform the policy options, it became clear that there is limited research in this field. Therefore, in January 2018, the Department for Transport initiated a 12-month programme of independent research with the purpose of gaining a better understanding of the ageing process of tyres. This research seeks to quantify the effect of age on a tyre’s integrity, provide guidance on whether an age limit is appropriate and, if so, what that limit should be. The findings of the research will inform decisions and will be published. \r\n\r\nIn advance of the research, the Government worked with the tyre industry, the Traffic Commissioners and the vehicle operating industry to improve tyre management.  In 2014, guidance was issued to all PSV operators and to the members of the trade associations - the Confederation of Passenger Transport and the Road Haulage Association. This guidance explained how to establish the age of a tyre and included a recommendation that any tyre over 10 years of age should only be fitted as part of a twin wheel arrangement on a rear axle. This initial guidance was supplemented by a more comprehensive tyre maintenance guide, produced by the tyre industry with the support of the Senior Traffic Commissioner and the Department for Transport (the Department), aimed at ensuring good tyre maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe Department ensured that a printed copy of this guide was delivered to every PSV operator. This guidance is also available on the British Tyre Manufacturers’ Association website (http://btmauk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/October-2016-CV-TyreManagement-LINKS-270916.pdf).\r\n\r\nIn parallel, Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) enforcement staff carried out spot checks on older buses and coaches to assess the age of tyres in this segment of the national fleet. These checks were in addition to their normal enforcement programme. A year after the initial guidance was published, a further survey of older buses and coaches indicated a reduction in the average age of tyres fitted in the PSV fleet and demonstrated widespread compliance with the published advice. \r\n\r\nThe combination of guidance and enforcement has been successful to date. Official figures show that in the period between June and September 2017, the DVSA conducted 28,524 roadworthiness inspections on PSVs. Of those, approximately 0.23% failed to meet the minimum requirements for tyres set down in regulation.  Approximately 0.03% of the vehicles had tyres older than 10 years fitted to the front axle and, importantly, only four of these vehicles (approximately 0.014%) had tyres older than 11 years. These figures indicate that the industry is adhering to the guidance that has been issued. DVSA vehicle examiners have been instructed to remain vigilant and to issue official advice notes to reinforce the message on those operators who have not followed best practice.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Department wants to go further in examining this important issue. It will continue to monitor the use of tyres in the PSV fleet and will look carefully at the evidence that emerges from the independent scientific research to determine what further measures are appropriate.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport","created_at":"2018-03-01T14:39:43.963Z","updated_at":"2018-03-01T14:39:43.963Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":214210,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/214210.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Accept a role as guarantor to the USS pension scheme","background":"The USS pension deficit is due to a \"self sufficiency in gilts\" valuation method that models what would happen if the pre-92 universities went bankrupt.

They are an important indicator of the great strides we have made in improving our waterways, with more than 5,300 miles of rivers being improved since 2010. There have been no reintroductions of otters by conservation groups since the late 1990s and the bulk of the recovery of the otter has been through natural re-colonisation.  \r\n\r\nA healthy otter population results from favourable conditions in the natural environment, including water quality and the availability of prey (including fish), as well as availability of breeding sites. Otters are found at low density, and limit their own populations through territorial activity. Carrying capacity is determined by environmental conditions.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence to suggest that otters have a major impact on wildlife as a whole, and although localised impacts could occur where otters have not been previously present for some time, they are a natural part of the freshwater ecosystem and we believe these systems will adapt to the return of the natural top predator.  \r\n\r\nWe do recognise that otters can in some instances impact on still water fisheries, which is why there is provision through the Angling Improvement Fund (AIF), administered by the Angling Trust on the Environment Agency’s behalf, to help deliver improvements including projects to protect fisheries from otter predation through the erection of otter-proof fencing.

As the national governing body for football in England, the FA is responsible for regulating, promoting and developing the game at every level.\r\n\r\nThe Sports Governance Code that came into force on 1 April 2017 applies to all sporting bodies in receipt of public funding from Sport England and UK Sport. It challenges the FA and all other governing bodies to demonstrate that they meet the highest standards of governance and regulation. The Code requires evidence that sports bodies operate efficiently and successfully while being transparent and representative of society.\r\n\r\nWe therefore welcome the reforms the FA has made to comply with the Code that include reducing its Board in size from 12 to 10 members, ensuring a more even gender split, and ensuring at least a quarter of its members are independent of football club interests. We believe that moving to a thoroughly strategic, accountable and representative Board with the right mix of skills, diversity and experience is the key to unlocking the long-term potential of football in this country, from grassroots up to the national teams.\r\n\r\nThe reform of the FA Council; changes to tenure, and the addition of new members will help ensure this body is also more representative of the modern game. The principle that all FA Committees should report to the Board is one we strongly support and is a requirement under the Code.\r\n\r\nWe are comfortable that the actions the FA has already taken and further actions it has agreed to implement to comply with the Sports Governance Code will improve its governance. This will continue to be monitored and managed through funding conditions which require ongoing compliance with the Code.\r\n\r\nThe Premier League (PL) and the English Football League (EFL) are not in receipt of public funding and therefore they and the clubs in their leagues are not regulated through the mandatory condition of funding which requires compliance with the Sports Governance Code. However, the PL and the EFL have established their own regulatory frameworks which clubs are required to comply with in order to participate in their respective leagues.\r\n\r\nIndeed we welcome the fact that the financial state of football clubs in this country is better now than at any time over the last 20 years. Measures introduced in recent years include the Leagues requiring business cases and proof of funds from club owners, a working relationship between clubs and HMRC over tax owed, and the adoption of financial fair play rules. Together these have helped curb club debt and promoted sustainability. However, football clubs and the football authorities cannot be complacent. They must keep these rules under constant review.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, with regard to ownership of clubs, the onus for the football authorities is ensuring the criteria (known as the ‘Owners and Directors (ODT) Test’) as to whom can hold a controlling interest in clubs is as robust as possible, that due diligence is carried out on owners and conditions on what they can and cannot do are laid down from the start. We are pleased the football authorities have agreed to keep the ODT test under regular review and to listen to supporters’ concerns. This promise was outlined in the report of the Government’s Expert Working Group on Supporter Ownership and Engagement published in January 2016.\r\n\r\nWe are clear that we do not expect that the PL or EFL’s rulebooks will be superseded but it is right that policy-making on disciplinary issues sits outside the Leagues. The Football Regulatory Authority for example, is a body responsible for regulatory, disciplinary and rule-making for football played in England. The membership of the body is jointly made up of representatives from the national game, professional game and independent non-executives. \r\n\r\nThe Independent Football Ombudsman is also there to receive and adjudicate on complaints which have failed to be resolved by football clubs or the football authorities.  The IFO is an important part of football’s self-regulatory system.\r\n\r\nWe accept that football governance must keep evolving if it is to keep pace with the challenges of the modern game and the global commercial attractiveness of English football. The Sports Governance Code helps, but the FA and other football bodies responsible for regulation of the game should continue to review how they are set up to ensure the effective running of the sport. At present, the regulatory framework that operates via league regulation through the PL and the EFL demonstrates there is already regulation of the governance of all football clubs. Where regulation is being managed by the existing authorities in football to the extent which it is, this negates the desire or need to establish an independent regulator\r\n\r\nDepartment for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","created_at":"2018-03-29T13:44:30.259Z","updated_at":"2018-03-29T13:44:30.259Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":209458,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/209458.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Theresa May: Cancel the invitation for Saudi Crown Prince to visit the UK","background":"We call on the Prime Minister to withdraw the invitation for the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to visit the UK.

","details":"The longstanding partnership between Saudi Arabia and the UK has helped make both of our countries safer and more prosperous. \r\n\r\nWe have vital national security and economic interests in maintaining and developing our strong relationship, including how we can work together to tackle international challenges such as terrorism and extremism. As the Prime Minister said when she attended the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) in 2016 “intelligence we have received in the past from Saudi Arabia has saved potentially hundreds of lives in the UK.”\r\n\r\nEngagement with Saudi Arabia provides an opportunity to further develop our relationship, building the trust and respect necessary to enhance our engagement on all areas of mutual concern. Visits in both directions are an important opportunity for us to have constructive discussions about the full range of issues that are of mutual concern. \r\n\r\nThe Crown Prince has embarked on a series of reforms to modernise society and the economy within Saudi Arabia. The country is changing rapidly, with steps such as allowing women to drive and attend football matches, reopening cinemas and a commitment that women will make up one third of the Saudi workforce by 2030. The Crown Prince has also set out his commitment to return Saudi Arabia to a moderate Islam that is open to all religions.\r\n\r\nThis greater inclusivity is vital for the future of Saudi Arabia and the UK will support Saudi Arabia as it embarks on this era of change. The Crown Prince’s agenda will bring new opportunities for us to work together for the long-term benefit, stability and success of both our countries. \r\nWe welcome the recent positive developments, but we also recognise that there are further steps to take. \r\nOur starting point for engagement on human rights with all countries is based on what is practical, realistic and achievable, and we will always be ready to speak out as a matter of principle. We raise our concerns with the Saudi Arabian authorities using a range of Ministerial and diplomatic channels of communication, including our Ambassador, the Embassy team and the European Union in Riyadh. So whilst there are areas where we will continue to have different views to Saudi Arabia – including human rights - our relationship enables us to speak frankly, openly and constructively about these issues.\r\n\r\nOn Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, along with other GCC member states, provided support to the Government of Bahrain in 2011 as part of the Peninsula Shield agreement. At the request of the Government of Bahrain, GCC security personnel were deployed to Bahrain to ensure vital infrastructure was secure. The UK monitors events in Bahrain closely and where we have concerns we raise these at senior levels. \r\n\r\nThe UK is committed to securing a political solution that ends the humanitarian disaster in Yemen, and supports the UN Special Envoy to Yemen in facilitating a credible peace process. The UK will continue to play a leading role in supporting the UN to find a peaceful solution to the conflict, including through close engagement with our regional and international partners. Inward visits provide further opportunities for the UK to discuss solutions to the crisis. \r\n\r\nThe UK supports the Saudi-led Coalition military intervention, which came at the request of the internationally-recognised Yemeni President Hadi, to deter aggression by the Houthis, and allow for the return of the legitimate Yemeni Government.  The Houthis have consistently failed to adhere to UN Security Council Resolutions, including by launching attacks against Saudi Arabia and shipping in the Bab al-Mandab strait.\r\n\r\nWe regularly raise the importance of compliance with International Humanitarian Law (IHL) with the Saudi Arabian Government and other members of the military Coalition. Saudi Arabia has publicly stated that it is investigating reports of alleged violations of IHL, and that lessons will be acted upon.  We continue to monitor the situation closely.\r\n\r\nThe UK government takes its defence export responsibilities very seriously and operates one of the most robust export control regimes in the world. We rigorously examine every application on a case-by-case basis against the Consolidated EU and National arms export licensing Criteria and continue to keep our defence exports under careful review to ensure they meet these standards.
