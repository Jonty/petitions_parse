Winter tyres are made of a different rubber compound with a high silica content which makes them softer and tread pattern has small slits in the tread blocks so they grip the road better, and allow you to safely brake on snow and ice. Drivers are better off with winter tyres whenever the temperature dips below 7C. Cars with winter tyres have significantly shorter braking distances about 20 percent on wet surfaces a little longer on snow/ice","state":"open","signature_count":13,"created_at":"2019-02-01T19:36:35.687Z","updated_at":"2019-02-19T23:30:49.430Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2019-02-19T16:12:32.500Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2019-02-03T15:44:56.436Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Keane Higgs","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":240130,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/240130.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Introcude machines in the supermarkets to recycle pet bottles, cans and get paid","background":"Encourage the government to install recyclable machines in the supermarkets to recycle pet bottles, cans and get paid in vouchers, this would encourage customers to recycle and get paid for that’s, that’s a win for win.","additional_details":"In my recent trip to Germany I went to a supermarket and realised that they have machines installed across every single supermarket that’s encourages customers to recycle pet bottles and cans, furthermore they get vouchers from the supermarket that reduces their daily shopping costs by just recycling their cans and bottles. living in the uk, this is a must it’s win-win for both sides, customers bring the materials and get paid, the government reduced the plastic cost and reuses the old plastic.","state":"open","signature_count":13,"created_at":"2019-02-01T11:14:55.329Z","updated_at":"2019-02-19T11:19:38.660Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2019-02-13T16:50:43.779Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2019-02-01T11:57:27.552Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Alen Tzampaz","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":239501,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/239501.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Kids can drive at the age of 16","background":"If this goes into place then kids won't need a excuse for being late to school /college and will be able to travel to school then take transport which\r\n1.won't be as packed which will cause less arguments/ fights\r\n2.will also give kids experience for jobs in the future.","additional_details":"","state":"open","signature_count":13,"created_at":"2019-01-28T11:12:45.956Z","updated_at":"2019-02-19T09:20:01.227Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2019-02-04T13:38:34.133Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2019-01-28T11:39:00.052Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Alfie David Clark","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":239251,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/239251.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Provide funding for school children to access leisure centres or gyms\r\n \r\n","background":"Leisure centre memberships are expensive and many families cannot afford them.
