We have always been clear that as a matter of policy our notification under Article 50 will not be withdrawn.","details":"The British people voted to leave the EU, and it is the duty of the Government to deliver on their instruction. There can be no attempt to stay in the EU.\r\n\r\nThe result of the referendum held on 23 June 2016 saw a majority of people vote to leave the European Union. This was the biggest democratic mandate for a course of action ever directed at any UK Government. Following this, Parliament authorised the Prime Minister to trigger Article 50, passing the EU (Notification of Withdrawal) Act.\r\n\r\nIn last year’s General Election, over 80% of people then voted for parties committing to respecting the result of the referendum. It was the stated policy of both major parties that the decision of the people would be respected. The Government is clear that it is now its duty to implement the will of the electorate.\r\n\r\nThis was not a decision made after just a few weeks of campaigning, but one that came after a debate that had taken place both in Parliament and across the country for decades. \r\n\r\nWe are committed to making a success of the British people’s decision to leave the European Union.  And that is how we have always approached the negotiations -  anticipating success, not failure. It is vital that we try to reach an agreement that builds a strong relationship between Britain and the EU as neighbours, allies and partners. Not just for those who voted to leave but for every citizen of the United Kingdom. We were given a national mandate and this Government is determined to deliver a deal in the national interest. \r\n\r\nAs the Prime Minister has said: “This is about more than the decision to leave the EU; it is about whether the public can trust their politicians to put in place the decision they took.” The British people can trust this Government to honour the referendum result and get the best deal possible. To do otherwise would be to undermine the decision of the British people. The premise that the people can trust their politicians to deliver on the promises they make and will deliver them in Parliament is fundamental to our democracy.\r\n\r\nOur focus is making a success of Brexit and attempting to get the best deal possible. A deal that is in the interests of both the United Kingdom and the European Union. And one that takes in both economic and security cooperation.\r\n\r\nIt is the Government’s duty to deliver the will of the people and reach a desirable final outcome.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Exiting the European Union","created_at":"2018-08-01T12:20:25.369Z","updated_at":"2018-09-13T16:04:30.428Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":"2018-09-10","transcript_url":"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2018-09-10/debates/765648D6-5872-49B6-AA13-4E9AC0DA923C/VoteLeaveCampaignElectoralLaw","video_url":"https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/f5d8b613-0156-4925-a54f-958105fd7bb5","debate_pack_url":"https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CDP-2018-0202","overview":""}}},{"type":"petition","id":222419,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/222419.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Reject calls to add Staffordshire Bull Terriers to the Dangerous Dogs Act","background":"PETA, an organisation that is meant to be dedicated to protecting animals, has proposed to the UK government that it should add Staffordshire Bull Terriers to the dangerous dogs act, effectively banning them outright.

There are four types of dog to which the prohibition applies: (i) pitbull terrier; (ii) Japanese tosa; (iii) dogo Argentino; and (iv) fila Braziliero. However, although it is an offence to keep one of these types of dog there are exemptions for individual dogs where it has been shown to a court that they do not pose a safety risk to others.  The exemptions are subject to conditions (i.e. neutered, insured against injuring third parties, muzzled and on a lead when in public).\r\n\r\nThe Government considers that the prohibition on certain types of dogs forms an important part of the measures needed to tackle irresponsible ownership of dogs. Other important measures already in place include: an offence to allow a dog, of any type or breed, to be dangerously out of control; allowing police and local authorities to issue community protection notices to irresponsible owners whose dogs are causing low level problems; and civil law allowing courts to impose restrictions on individual dogs that are found to be dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe Parliamentary Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (EFRA) (not Government) are currently reviewing the law on the prohibition on certain types of dogs.

That’s what the British public voted for and that is what we will deliver. \r\n\r\nNegotiations are progressing well and we are confident of a deal this autumn. We have been having regular discussions with the EU on the future framework, outlining our positions on a wide range of topics covering the future security partnership and the future economic partnership, and we remain confident of reaching agreement on the Withdrawal Agreement and Future Framework. \r\n\r\nWe have now locked down the text on the majority of other separation issues. Taken with the agreement reached in March on the implementation period, on citizens’ rights and on the financial settlement - we have now reached agreement on around 80% of the Withdrawal Agreement. This provides important certainty for businesses and individuals.\r\n \r\nThe Government has also published its White Paper on the future relationship, which is our vision for a bold, ambitious and innovative new partnership with the EU. Principled and practical, faithful to the referendum, it delivers a deal that is good for the UK, and good for our EU friends.\r\n\r\nNow that the White Paper has been published, our negotiations with the EU are accelerating and intensifying. We have already seen an increase in pace with Michel Barnier now pledging ‘continuous negotiations’. We expect the EU to engage seriously with the proposals and both negotiating teams to work at pace to reach a substantive agreement on the Future Framework in the autumn. \r\n\r\nWe firmly believe it is in the interests of both the EU and the UK to strike a deal. That remains the goal on both sides and we are confident that this will be achieved. But it is the job of a responsible Government to prepare for all scenarios, including the unlikely event that we reach March 2019 without agreeing a deal. \r\n\r\nWe have already carried out very significant ‘no deal’ preparations and have been publishing a series of notices so that businesses and citizens have time to prepare. This does not reflect an increased likelihood of ‘no deal;’ an acceleration at this point was long-planned to ensure plans are in place by March 2019 in the unlikely scenario they are needed.\r\n\r\nOur objective in our preparations is to minimise disruption and to prioritise continuity and stability, including for businesses, at the border, as well as for EU citizens in the UK.\r\n\r\nOver the past year we have spent time talking to businesses across different industries about how they could be preparing for exit. The notices published on gov.uk over the last few weeks provide further information in order to guide businesses on how they can best prepare for our exit from the EU. We will continue working closely with industries that are most affected by ‘no deal’ plans and implementation, particularly to understand how we can support businesses in making the transition outside of the European Union.\r\n\r\nAt the border, we will continue to apply highly automated, risk based and intelligence targeted customs controls when the UK leaves the EU. As they do today, HMRC will work closely with industry to ensure its interventions are conducted in a way which minimises delays and additional burdens for legitimate trade, while robustly ensuring compliance.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister has been clear from the beginning of this process that she wants EU Citizens and their families in the UK to be able to stay. She gave a clear commitment to EU citizens in October, when she said “I couldn’t be clearer: EU citizens living lawfully in the UK today will be able to stay.” The UK will move swiftly to safeguard the future of EU citizens, regardless of the outcome of negotiations.\r\n\r\nWhilst striking a deal with our EU partners remains our top priority, we are supporting businesses and citizens to prepare for all scenarios and stepping up preparations to ensure that ‘no deal’ plans are well-developed. Over the coming months more of these preparations will become clear, while our focus and discussions with the EU remain on achieving the ambitious and positive deal we hope for and expect.\r\n\r\nWhatever the outcome of our negotiations, we stand ready to make a success of Brexit.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Exiting the European Union.","created_at":"2018-10-03T09:06:32.219Z","updated_at":"2018-10-03T09:06:32.219Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":226071,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/226071.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Stop possible second referendum on E.U. membership","background":"There is a growing band of people that want to reverse the result of the democratic vote of this country to leave the European Union and are calling for a second referendum.

These are designed to raise the public’s awareness of specific cancer symptoms; encourage people with those symptoms to go to the doctor; and diagnose cancer at an earlier stage, and therefore make it more treatable, and thereby improve cancer survival rates.\r\n\r\nThe UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) advises ministers and the NHS in all four countries about all aspects of screening policy and supports implementation.  Using research evidence, pilot programmes and economic evaluation, it assesses the evidence for programmes against a set of internationally recognised criteria.  In 2012 the UK NSC recommended that the age of the first invitation for cervical screening should be age 25.  This was based on evidence that a large number of women below this age received relatively little benefit from being screened and treated.  It is only where the offer to screen provides more good than harm that a screening programme is recommended. This UK NSC recommendation also concurred with a major review by the Advisory Committee on Cervical Screening in 2009.\r\n\r\nCervical cancer in women under the age of 25 is very rare with 2.6 cases per 100,000 women. Importantly, younger women often undergo natural and harmless changes in the cervix that screening could identify as cervical abnormalities, and in most cases these abnormalities resolve themselves without any need for intervention.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of screening is to reduce mortality and morbidity from cancer and other conditions in the population who appear healthy and have no symptoms, by detecting conditions at an earlier, more treatable stage.\r\n\r\nPeople with symptoms are encouraged to contact their general practitioner as soon as possible and work is ongoing to ensure that GPs are aware of the symptoms and the need to refer for further investigation. Guidance is available for the primary care of young women who present with gynaecological symptoms, and was developed and published in March 2010.  The guidance ‘Clinical practice guidelines for the assessment of young women aged 20-24 with abnormal vaginal bleeding’ was produced by a multi-disciplinary group, including professionals, patients and the voluntary sector, and was endorsed by the relevant Royal Colleges.

The current childcare offer is comprehensive, it is broad ranging and reflects different family circumstances, covering children over a range of ages - including birth to 3.\r\n\r\nThis government has done more than any other to help parents with childcare costs, spending more than ever before: around £6 billion per year by 2020. We are fully focused on embedding three significant childcare measures: Tax Free Childcare, available to parents with children 0-16; Universal Credit (UC), providing up to 85% of childcare costs for children 0-12 and extending our free educational entitlements by offering 30 hours free childcare for 3 and 4-year-olds for working parents earning up to £100,000.\r\n\r\nUC is rolling out now. We know the best way to help families improve their lives is by supporting parents into employment and UC offers parents tailored support to move into work that fits around their caring responsibilities. Working parents can claim back up to 85% of eligible childcare costs under UC, which is worth up to £646 per month for one child or £1,108 per month for someone with two or more children. If someone has accepted an offer of paid work, they are eligible to be paid these costs for the month prior to starting work. For an existing UC claimant unable to pay for upfront childcare costs in the month that they start work or increase their working hours, budgeting advances are also available. By March 2023 UC will have replaced Working Tax Credits under which, currently, working families on lower incomes can get up to 70% of their childcare costs paid.\r\n\r\nAdditional support is available for disadvantaged children. For 2-year-olds, 15 hours per week of free childcare is available for families receiving UC with an annual net earned income up to £15,400 and for families receiving other benefits currently qualifying them for free school meals. Also eligible are those receiving working tax credits (with an annual gross household income of no more than £16,190). Children entitled to certain benefits or support for a disability or special educational need, looked after children and certain children who have been in care, including those who’ve been adopted, can also receive this offer.\r\n\r\nUniversally free early education is available to all 3 and 4-year-old children in England. The Government introduced 15 hours universal free childcare, which provides 570 hours per year free childcare from the term starting after a child’s 3rd birthday. Worth around £2,500 on average per year, it helps children to develop social skills and prepares them for school.\r\n\r\nThe 30 hours free childcare offer for 3 and 4-year-olds supports parents working at least 16 hours per week, earning at least the national minimum wage(NMW;  this can be a sole parent in a single parent family who only has to earn £125 per week – or the equivalent of 16 hours at the NMW – to be able to access the 30 hours offer) and up to a maximum of £100,000 per year. 30 Hours provides an additional 570 hours per year above the universal 15 hours entitlement, saving families and estimated £5,000 per year in total.\r\n\r\nSharing the same eligibility criteria as 30 hours, Tax-Free Childcare (TFC), broadens access to childcare, enabling more parents to work. Parents can receive up to £2,000 per year per child under 12 (or £4,000 per year per disabled child under 17). TFC is not available to those in receipt of Universal Credit, Tax Credits or Childcare Vouchers.\r\n\r\nSome employers offer the Childcare Voucher Scheme (CVS), which can save parents of under 16s (17s if disabled) who are basic rate taxpayers up to £933 per parent per year in tax relief. CVS is being replaced by TFC and will close to new entrants from 4 October 2018. Shared Parental Leave, another employment-related scheme, allows parents to share up to 50 weeks’ leave and up to 37 weeks’ pay in the first year following their child’s birth or adoption. This has particular value in supporting working mothers back to work.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Government is committed to ensuring that every child gets the best start in life. A cross-government working group has been set up to review the support available for families from conception to age 2. The group will seek to identify gaps in the support currently available and make recommendations on how co-ordination across departments can be improved. \r\n\r\nFurther information:\r\n\r\nOn current benefits: \r\nhttps://www.childcarechoices.gov.uk/\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/shared-parental-leave-and-pay \r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/childcare-grant).\r\n\r\nOn the working group: \r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/leader-of-the-commons-to-chair-ministerial-group-on-family-support-from-conception-to-the-age-of-two\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education","created_at":"2018-08-03T15:58:16.204Z","updated_at":"2018-10-12T12:02:26.019Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":219576,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/219576.json"},"attributes":{"action":"British Soldiers who served in N.

It is only due to the courageous efforts of our security forces that we have the relative peace and stability that Northern Ireland enjoys today. Our security forces ensured that Northern Ireland’s future will only ever be decided by democracy and consent, and never by violence. Over 250,000 people served in Northern Ireland during Operation Banner, the longest continuous military deployment in our country’s history, the vast majority with courage, professionalism and great distinction. This Government will never forget the debt of gratitude we owe them.\r\n\r\nCriminal investigations and prosecutions are a matter for the police and prosecuting authorities who act independently of government and politicians. This Government believes in the rule of law.  Where there is evidence of wrongdoing it is right that this should be investigated and, where the evidence exists, for prosecutions to follow. We do not support amnesties or immunity from prosecution. \r\n\r\nThis Government remains committed to the full implementation of the legacy institutions in the Stormont House Agreement of December 2014. The Agreement includes a commitment to establish new legacy institutions, among them a Historical Investigations Unit (HIU) to take forward outstanding investigations into Troubles-related deaths.\r\n\r\nOn 11 May 2018, the UK Government published a consultation paper entitled ‘Addressing the legacy of Northern Ireland’s past’.  The consultation sets out how the institutions are designed to address different aspects of the legacy of the past. The general principles underpinning the proposed new institutions are set out, including the requirement to operate in ways that are balanced, proportionate, transparent, fair and equitable.  The Government believes that these institutions, which represent the balance of a political agreement between all the parties to the Stormont House Agreement provide the best way to address the legacy of Northern Ireland’s past. \r\n\r\nThe HIU will deal with deaths in chronological order. This will ensure terrorist murders, including 185 murders of soldiers, are investigated and any evidential leads pursued. These include the murders of 18 soldiers at Warrenpoint in 1979 and eight in the Ballygawley bus bombing.\r\n\r\nThe HIU would take on the outstanding work of the Police Service of Northern Ireland’s (PSNI’s) Historical Enquiries Team and the outstanding legacy work of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.  \r\n\r\nIn order to ensure expeditious investigations and to bring an end to investigations into the past, the HIU will be time-limited, with an objective to complete its work in 5 years and specific obligations governing the extent to which a case requires further investigation.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the current investigatory mechanisms, the new institutions will be victim-centred but also include statutory controls on the way that they operate, such as time-limits, strictly defined remits and safeguards to protect national security. These measures aim to bring to a close investigations into the past and have the potential to provide better outcomes for victims and survivors who suffered most during the Troubles.\r\n\r\nNorthern Ireland Office","created_at":"2018-06-11T16:05:07.631Z","updated_at":"2018-06-11T16:05:07.631Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":228572,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/228572.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make TV election debates happen - establish an Independent Debates Commission","background":"Genuine leaders' debates took place in 2010, but in the next two elections didn't happen.

Published in July 2016, the Framework, which sets out the essential skills and knowledge needed for all staff working with people with a learning disability in health and social care settings, is structured in three tiers, or levels of training, to reflect the different levels of knowledge specific roles would require. \r\n\r\nTier one, which is relevant to the entire health and care workforce including ancillary staff, concerns general awareness skills and attitudes.  \r\n\r\nTier two is aimed at developing the knowledge and skills of staff that are likely to have regular contact with people with a learning disability. \r\n\r\nTier three is aimed at enhancing the knowledge, skills and attitudes of key staff and is relevant to those who are managing care and support services for people with a learning disability. \r\n\r\nEmployers and/or commissioners of education should use the Framework as guidance for the development and delivery of appropriate and consistent education and training, as well as for identifying the skills needed for particular roles in line with their legal responsibilities. By doing so, this will result in safer and more effective practice. \r\n\r\nTo ensure that health and care staff also have appropriate knowledge and awareness of autism, the Department of Health and Social Care has commissioned the development of a Core Skills and Competency Framework for Autism, which will be in line with the tiered approach adopted by other core skills frameworks. The development of this framework is expected to improve the availability of general awareness training to all staff across the health and care system and wider public services to equip them to offer appropriate support to autistic people (Tier 1), as well as developing and enhancing the knowledge, skills and attitudes for roles that have regular contact with autistic people (Tiers 2 and 3).\r\n\r\nThe recent annual report of the Learning Disability Mortality Review (LeDeR) Programme highlighted that people with a learning disability are still dying prematurely due to avoidable factors.

This has provided flexibility and created a sustainable model for universities and healthcare workforce supply. \r\n\r\nTo underpin these reforms, we have made additional funding available to universities and trusts to fund up to 5,000 additional clinical training placements every year from September 2018. \r\n\r\nWe are working with Health Education England (HEE) and the university sector to ensure students continue to apply for courses up to the end of clearing in October 2018 and in future years. \r\n\r\nUCAS will publish the final application numbers on the 13 December 2018.  \r\nThere is still strong demand for nursing courses and we have opened extra routes into nursing for those who may not want to study a full-time degree.

In addition, many additional funding incentives have been put in place to support students whilst undertaking the mandatory clinical placement element of their courses. \r\n\r\nEligible healthcare students have access to additional non-repayable grants of £1,000 for childcare, funding for travel to clinical placements and an exceptional support fund of up to £3,000 per student per academic year.

Our immigration policies are based on principles of fairness to legal migrants and not rewarding those who do not abide by the Rules.","details":"The Government does not believe that introducing a blanket amnesty for illegal migrants wishing to regularise their immigration status would be the correct approach. It would reward illegality, undermine the Immigration Rules for applying for leave to enter or remain, which Parliament has approved, and would be unfair to those migrants who come to the UK legally and observe immigration conditions. It could also encourage more migrants to attempt to enter or stay in the country illegally in the hope that they would be treated similarly. This additional risk of encouraging further illegal migration could potentially endanger individuals and their families by placing them in the hands of unscrupulous traffickers. \r\n\r\nImmigration Rules have been designed to be fair and to treat people with respect and dignity, but also firm with those who do not abide by the Rules, and that ensure people come to the UK for the right reasons – to work hard and contribute to our economy and society. \r\n\r\nIt is important that we distinguish between those who are here legally and those who are here illegally. We recognise the devastating consequences that illegal migration can have on individuals who become vulnerable to exploitation. We are committed to tackling the organised crime groups who profit from illegal migration and protecting those who are at risk of exploitation.   \r\nThere are routes available for individuals who believe they have a right to remain in the UK on the basis of family or private life, or other human rights grounds. Those who wish to can apply under the Immigration Rules and each application is considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the individual circumstances. \r\n\r\nIt is important that there are clear incentives to comply with the Immigration Rules. This means for example that private life established here while a person is in the UK unlawfully or while their immigration status is precarious should be accorded little weight. Full details can be found on GOV.UK by searching for Appendix FM 1.0b Family Life (as a Partner or Parent) and Private Life: 10-year Routes here: www.homeoffice.gov.uk. Balancing the individual right to respect for private or family life with the public interest in safeguarding the economic well-being of the UK by controlling immigration is a legitimate objective. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, we recognise some people arrived in the UK many years ago and do not have documentation confirming their immigration status.  They have faced difficulties in proving their right to work, to rent property and to access benefits and services to which they are entitled. The Government has apologised to people in this position and has made a commitment to help them get the documents they need.  \r\n \r\nOn 16 April, a Taskforce was established to make immediate arrangements to help those who needed it. This included setting up a helpline to get in touch with the Home Office. \r\n \r\nOn 24 May, the Home Secretary announced the Windrush Scheme to make it easier for people to access the support they need. Those applying under this Scheme will benefit from the services of the Taskforce which will help people to navigate the immigration system and will continue to take a sympathetic and proactive approach when resolving applications.\r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2018-06-06T15:52:57.340Z","updated_at":"2018-06-06T15:52:57.340Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":218343,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/218343.json"},"attributes":{"action":"End the animal cruelty laws exemptions given to UK halal and shechita abattoirs","background":"The EU’s 2009 slaughter regulation requires all animals, including poultry, be stunned before slaughter.

The issue was first debated in Parliament in 1875. The Slaughter of Animals Act 1933 introduced a legal requirement for stunning of animals prior to slaughter but contained an exemption where animals were slaughtered for consumption by Jewish and Muslim communities. Over the years the national rules governing religious slaughter have developed to provide additional protection to animals that are slaughtered in accordance with religious rites.\r\n\r\nEU Regulation 1099/2009, on the protection of animals at time of killing, requires all animals to be stunned before slaughter except where animals are slaughtered in accordance with religious rites. The EU Regulation and the Welfare of Animals at Time of Killing (England) Regulations 2015 (WATOK) include strict requirements on where, how and who can slaughter animals in accordance with religious rites. These requirements are monitored and enforced by Official Veterinarians of the Food Standards Agency to ensure that animals are spared unnecessary suffering, distress or pain during the slaughter process.\r\n\r\nThe legislation also requires each person either handling or carrying out slaughter operations, including religious slaughter, to hold a Certificate of Competence. A person must undergo formal training, understand their responsibilities for the protection of animal welfare during slaughter operations and consistently demonstrate competent performance in order to pass the independent examination to obtain a Certificate of Competence.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","created_at":"2018-06-18T11:41:47.342Z","updated_at":"2018-06-18T11:41:47.342Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":218952,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/218952.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make everyone with a life time disability mental or physical have life time pip","background":"It's completely unfair that people with life time disability mental or physical have to repeatedly go through forms, face to face interviews, mandatory considerations and tribunals.

We want to enable disabled people to have the same opportunities and choices as non-disabled people. We have, therefore, designed Personal Independence Payment (PIP) to reflect a modern understanding of disability, treating all conditions fairly.\r\n\r\nPIP maintains the key principles of Disability Living Allowance as a non-means-tested cash benefit available to people in and out of work but which is delivered in a fairer and more consistent manner. It is only right that support is targeted at those disabled people who require the most assistance to lead independent lives and PIP is achieving that; 29 per cent of the 1.6 million claimants now receiving PIP getting it at the highest level (£143.35 a week) compared to 15 per cent for working age Disability Living Allowance prior to the introduction of PIP.\r\n\r\nPIP is needs-based and not condition based and reviews are a key part of the benefit to ensure that the right support continues to be delivered. \r\n\r\nIn terms of award lengths and reviews, once someone has been awarded PIP, which can be paid at one of eight rates, that award will be reviewed. Reviews of PIP are a key part of the benefit and ensure that not only do awards remain correct where needs may change but that we also maintain contact with the claimant, both features missing from its predecessor Disability Living Allowance. Importantly, the length of an award is based on an individual’s circumstances and can vary from nine months to an on-going award, with a light touch review at the ten year point. \r\n\r\nHowever, PIP already recognises that for the most severely disabled claimants, the award review process could seem unnecessarily intrusive. That is why we introduced changes so that existing claimants with the most severe, lifetime disabilities, whose functional ability has remained the same, are more likely to have their evidence reviewed by a DWP Decision Maker and will not need to have a face-to-face assessment with a healthcare professional.\r\n\r\nThe Government are committed to ensuring that the PIP reassessment process works effectively across the spectrum of disabilities and health conditions, including mental health conditions, cognitive impairments and physical disabilities.\r\n\r\nGoing forward, one of our key priorities will be to ensure that those  with progressive or degenerative conditions for which functional limitation is likely to stay the same or worsen who are awarded the highest level of support get an award duration that is appropriate to the condition and needs arising – something we acknowledge that is not always happening. We are therefore developing a solution through changes to guidance which will ensure that those receiving the highest level of support get an appropriate award duration.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions","created_at":"2018-05-17T16:55:38.282Z","updated_at":"2018-05-17T16:55:38.282Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":219512,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/219512.json"},"attributes":{"action":"The Government should end experiments on dogs.","background":"The evidence that using dogs in regulatory testing advances scientific knowledge or human safety is limited, yet it causes immense suffering to thousands of dogs every year.

The legislation requires that new medicines are generally tested in a rodent and a non-rodent species before human clinical trials can begin.

This is a temporary measure, to safeguard patients’ safety. ","details":"On 27 September 2018 the Board of Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust made a decision that, if relevant medical and nursing staffing could not be improved in the short-term, it would temporarily suspend on patient safety grounds the overnight A\u0026E services provided by the Emergency Department at the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford. \r\n\r\nThis decision was taken by the Board in light of concerns that there are currently insufficient medical and nursing staff to ensure safe overnight A\u0026E services for patients at the Princess Royal Hospital. To keep both Emergency Departments at the Trust open in the short-term and thus avoid the temporary overnight closure of the Princess Royal Hospital’s Emergency Department, the Trust has advised that it needs an absolute minimum of at least 7 more Middle Grade Doctors and 15 more Registered A\u0026E Nurses in order to ensure safe overnight A\u0026E services for patients at the Princess Royal Hospital.\r\n\r\nThe Trust has, with the support of NHS Improvement and local partners, made significant recruitment efforts, including overseas recruitment, in support of its A\u0026E services and continues to do so, although it has been currently unable to recruit sufficient staff to address the A\u0026E staffing issues at the Princess Royal Hospital’s Emergency Department. The Trust is also engaging with key local stakeholders, such as MPs and councillors, as part of this work. \r\n\r\nAlthough every effort is being made by the Trust and its partners in the local health system to avoid the overnight closure, including engagement with neighbouring Trusts to explore all options for securing additional staff, it is unlikely that other local Trusts will be in a position to provide sufficient staff to resolve the A\u0026E staffing issues at the Princess Royal Hospital in the immediate future.\r\n\r\nThe Trust has advised that should the temporary overnight closure become unavoidable after it has explored all options, it would not happen until some time in November 2018 and would likely last for at least 6 months, with any re-opening decision by the Board depending on whether the Emergency Department would be able to provide safe services to patients. Relevant partners in the system, including the West Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust, have been engaging with the Trust to refine the details of potential closure plans, and the West Midlands Clinical Senate will also undertake a review of the options to ensure that patient safety is prioritised and that proposals fit with national guidance. \r\n\r\nThe Trust is also reviewing its business continuity arrangements to ensure that there is as minimal impact on patients as possible in the event of an overnight closure, and is also exploring options for patients in need of urgent rather than emergency care out of hours. \r\n\r\nIf the closure becomes unavoidable to ensure patient safety, the Trust has advised that this would mean that:\r\nthe Princess Royal Hospital’s Emergency Department would be closed overnight between 20:00 and 08:00;\r\nthe Princess Royal Hospital’s Emergency Department would be closed to ambulance admissions at 20:00 and ambulances would be diverted to neighbouring Trusts;\r\nthe Urgent Care Centre would accept patients until 20:00;\r\nthe Princess Royal Hospital would continue to accept GP-referred admissions in those specialities managed at the site between 08:00 and 20:00, 7 days a week; and\r\nstroke patients arriving by ambulance would be admitted via a direct pathway to the appropriate clinical ward.\r\n\r\nIn the event of the closure becoming unavoidable, the Trust will be putting in place a communications programme for the benefit of the public, staff and other stakeholders once a final overnight suspension management plan has been agreed.\r\n\r\nMinisters at the Department of Health and Social Care have also taken a keen interest in efforts to support the Trust, and have engaged with NHS Improvement and relevant stakeholders as part of this.

There are four types of dog to which the prohibition applies: (i) pitbull terrier; (ii) Japanese tosa; (iii) dogo Argentino; and (iv) fila Braziliero. However, although it is an offence to keep one of these types of dog there are exemptions for individual dogs where it has been shown to a court that they do not pose a safety risk to others.  The exemptions are subject to conditions (i.e. neutered, insured against injuring third parties, muzzled and on a lead when in public).\r\n\r\nThe Government considers that the prohibition on certain types of dogs forms an important part of the measures needed to tackle irresponsible ownership of dogs. Other important measures already in place include: an offence to allow a dog, of any type or breed, to be dangerously out of control; allowing police and local authorities to issue community protection notices to irresponsible owners whose dogs are causing low level problems; and civil law allowing courts to impose restrictions on individual dogs that are found to be dangerous.\r\n\r\nFigures provided by the Metropolitan Police show that nearly 20% of dog attacks in London were committed by pit bull type dogs. This is a far higher proportion than one would expect, given the population of pit bulls in this country. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","created_at":"2018-08-03T14:17:00.844Z","updated_at":"2018-08-03T14:17:00.844Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":217985,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/217985.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Bring in laws to protect horses being ridden on roads","background":"Horses need legal protection from drivers who hit or kill horses being ridden on the roads, as it stands the only law is dangerous driving around horses which is hard to prove as the highway code only gives ADVICE on how to pass horses which means drivers cannot be prosecuted. laws need updating","additional_details":"Horses are being left  dead on our roads with no compensation to the owner or business.

Road users are required to comply with road traffic law, in the interests of the safety of all road users.","details":"If road users do not adopt a responsible attitude, or if their use of the highway creates an unsafe environment or causes nuisance to other road users, there are laws in place that can make them liable for prosecution. The relevant offences include driving dangerously, driving without due care and attention and driving without reasonable consideration for other road users, as set out in Rule 144 of The Highway Code. The Highway Code can be viewed online at: \r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-highway-code\r\n\r\nAlthough failure to comply with the ‘advisory rules’ of the Code will not, in itself, cause a person to be prosecuted, The Highway Code may be used in evidence in any court proceedings (under the Traffic Acts) to establish liability. This includes the rules which use advisory wording, such as ‘should/should not’ or ‘do/do not’. \r\n\r\nEnforcement of the law is a matter for the police, who will decide on the evidence in each individual case whether an offence has been committed and the appropriate action to take. \r\n\r\nThe Department recognises the importance of the safety of both riders and their horses, on public roads. Every opportunity is taken to remind motorists of their responsibilities towards vulnerable road users, including horse riders. The Highway Code provides the following advice: \r\n\r\nRule 163:\r\nOvertake only when it is safe and legal to do so.\r\n\r\nYou should give motorcyclists, cyclists and horse riders at least as much room as \r\nyou would when overtaking a car.\r\n\r\nRule 215\r\nHorse riders and horse-drawn vehicles. Be particularly careful of horse riders and horse-drawn vehicles especially when overtaking. Always pass wide and slowly. Horse riders are often children, so take extra care and remember riders may ride in double file when escorting a young or inexperienced horse or rider. Look out for horse riders’ and horse drivers’ signals and heed a request to slow down or stop. Take great care and treat all horses as a potential hazard; they can be unpredictable, despite the efforts of their rider/driver.\r\n\r\nThrough the THINK! Road Safety Campaign, the Department has previously worked with the British Horse Society (BHS) to support their “Dead Slow” campaign to encourage car drivers to pass horses safely. The Department was able to reinforce the BHS campaign by developing a short film that is being promoted as a public information film on UK TV stations. \r\n\r\nThe Department invested in promoting the film on YouTube and other social media, such as Twitter and Facebook. Leaflets and posters to support the campaign further reminded motorists of the need to be patient when they encounter horses on the road, and supplemented the advice already given in The Highway Code. The leaflets and posters are available free of charge from the THINK! online shop and they are often used by riding groups to support local campaigns. Road safety officers around the country were also encouraged to feature the campaign locally. \r\n\r\nThe driving theory test contains questions about how drivers should interact with vulnerable road users, including horse riders and the hazard perception test includes a number of clips where horse riders are the hazard, either directly or indirectly. These clips are refreshed and updated periodically.\r\n\r\nWhere there may speed related issues: The local traffic authorities are responsible for setting speed limits on local roads. They have the flexibility to set local speed limits, that are appropriate for the individual road, reflecting local needs and taking account of local considerations.

This includes a UK-EU free trade area for goods to ensure continued frictionless access at the border to each other's markets, underpinned by an upfront commitment to a common rulebook on goods and agri-food.\r\n\r\nWe have listened to EU leaders and we understand and respect the position that the four freedoms of the single market are indivisible and there can be no cherry-picking.\r\n\r\nThe Government’s proposals put our rights and responsibilities in a new balance that fulfils our joint ambition to establish a deep and special partnership once the UK has left the EU.\r\n\r\nThe White Paper also sets out a new proposal for a Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA) with the EU. The FCA is a business-friendly model that seeks to facilitate the greatest possible trade between the UK and its trading partners, whether in Europe or the rest of world, while allowing the UK to set its own tariffs. The FCA removes the need for new customs checks and controls between the UK and the EU, as if in a combined customs territory with the EU.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister has also been clear that in leaving the EU, we will also bring about an end to the jurisdiction of the CJEU in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe proposal set out in the White Paper delivers on that commitment. No longer will courts in the UK be able to refer cases to the CJEU, nor will the CJEU be able to arbitrate disputes between the UK and the EU.\r\n\r\nThe CJEU will no longer have the power to make laws for the UK and the principles of direct effect and of the supremacy of EU law will no longer apply in the UK. Instead, rights will be enforced in the UK by UK courts and in the EU by EU courts.\r\n\r\nThe UK will also leave the Common Agricultural Policy and Common Fisheries Policy. We will be able to design a domestic agricultural policy that works in the best interests of the UK. We will also be an independent coastal state under international law, and therefore be able to control and manage access to UK waters, including fisheries.\r\n\r\nAs the Prime Minister has said, our decision to leave the EU does not mark an end to our relationship with the EU. It marks a new beginning for our partnership with our European allies. However, the agreement we reach with the EU must respect the result of the referendum which was a vote to take control of our borders, laws and money.\r\n\r\nWe are confident that the we can reach a positive deal on our future partnership, as this would be to the mutual benefit of both the UK and the EU.

The prohibition on the delivery of knives to residential addresses is now limited to those knives that can cause serious injury. If ordered online these knives will need to be collected from a place where age verification can take place, either by the purchaser or their representative.\r\n \r\nIn respect of other bladed items and knives, the Bill provides a number of defences around the prohibition of delivery to a residential address.

Other items that would be exempt from the prohibition on delivery to a residential address would include encased razor blades; knives with a blade of less than 3 inches; knives that cannot cause serious injury, for example table knives; bladed products designed or manufactured to specifications from the buyer such as bespoke knives.

In 2015/16, 662,871 pupils learned to play a musical instrument through whole class ensemble teaching that was provided or supported by music education hubs. Pupils and parents cannot be charged for this teaching.

Service information to passengers has improved and considerable work is being undertaken to operate the services in the timetable. \r\n \r\nThis timetable change was intended to deliver the benefits to passengers of major investment in the rail network. This means, through the £7 billion Thameslink Programme, new trains and improved stations, including the rebuilding of London Bridge and Blackfriars. The programme and timetable changes were designed to provide more frequent and longer trains through central London to respond to the huge growth in passenger numbers that we have seen in recent years. But this timetable change instead has resulted in unacceptable disruption for passengers that rely on these services.\r\n \r\nThe process of introducing the new timetable was overseen by an Industry Readiness Board, which included representatives from Network Rail, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) and the train operating companies, and an Independent Assurance Panel. Both of these groups informed the Department that they had not been given any information to suggest that the implementation of the new timetable should be halted. These bodies were set up specifically to ensure that all parts of the rail network – Network Rail, GTR, other train operators - were ready to implement these major timetable changes. It should have been clear to them that some key parties were not ready; they did not raise this risk. As few as 3 weeks before the timetable was to be implemented GTR themselves assured the Transport Secretary they were ready to implement the changes. Clearly this was wrong, and it is totally unacceptable.\r\n \r\nInvestigations being carried out right now will give more information about what has gone wrong and why the industry remained of the view until the last moment that it would be able to deliver these changes. There has to be a proper investigation into events. Since this petition was launched the Chief Executive of GTR, Charles Horton, has resigned in order to make way for fresh leadership of GTR. Further action may need to be taken against GTR but only once we have the findings of these investigations. \r\n \r\nIt is right that the industry has apologised for the situation and that Charles Horton has stepped down, and it is right that we learn the lessons for the future, but right now the focus should remain on restoring the reliability of their service to passengers.\r\n\r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport","created_at":"2018-06-21T15:24:21.311Z","updated_at":"2018-06-22T10:12:42.012Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":228742,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/228742.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Protect library services by ringfencing government funding for libraries.","background":"Libraries across the country are being closed, cut back and/or outsourced to volunteers as a result of government cuts to local authority budgets.

Carer’s Allowance provides some recognition for caring: it’s not a carer’s wage however. By 2022/23 annual spend will be £4bn.","details":"The Government recognises the invaluable contribution that unpaid and family carers make in our communities and is committed to doing more to support them. The support we need to provide extends far beyond financial support however. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) published a Carers Action Plan ‘Supporting carers today’ in June this year, setting out plans to support carers. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/carers-action-plan-2018-to-2020\r\n \r\nDWP is part of DHSC’s Employers Accreditation Pilot and is working with DHSC on the Carers Discovery project. \r\n \r\nFormal carers, i.e. those who are employed as “professional” carers, do of course need to receive all the protections that employment law offers, including receiving at least the National Living Wage/National Minimum Wage from their employers. \r\n \r\nInformal carers are those who provide care for family or friends. They do receive help through the benefit system, primarily through Carer’s Allowance (CA) (introduced in 1976) and for those on lower incomes, through means-tested benefits. \r\n \r\nThough society values a carers contribution highly, it has never been the role of the benefit system to pay people for the tasks that they choose to undertake in the way that an employer would. The purpose of CA is to provide a measure of financial support and recognition for people who give up the opportunity of full-time employment in order to provide regular and substantial care for a severely disabled person, but it is not and never was, designed to be a carer’s wage or intended to replace foregone earnings entirely. \r\n \r\nA carer may apply for CA if they provide care for 35 hours or more a week to a person on a qualifying disability benefits. The carer must be aged 16 years or over and not in full time education (defined as 21 hours or more a week). For those carers who can undertake some part-time work, there is an earnings limit in CA. CA can be received alongside part-time earnings of up to £120 net of certain expenses a week. Allowable expenses include income tax, National Insurance contributions and half of any contributions to an occupational or personal pension. Also, up to half the net earnings figure calculated can be allowed towards the cost of alternative care for the disabled person, or for a child aged under 16, while the carer is at work. These rules mean people can earn significantly more than the earnings limit and still get CA. Where possible, informal carers are encouraged to continue either working or studying part-time alongside their caring responsibilities in order to improve their own life chances and increase their social interaction. \r\n \r\nCA is funded from general taxation and is up-rated in line with the Consumer Price Index. Since 2010 the rate has increased from £53.90 to £64.60, meaning carers are £550 a year better off than they were in 2010. By 2022/23 we will be spending nearly £4 billion a year on CA. This is a clear indication of the Government’s commitment to carers.\r\n \r\nCarers on low incomes can also claim income-related benefits, such as Income Support and Pension Credit. These benefits can be paid to carers at a higher rate than those without caring responsibilities through the carer premium or equivalent additional amount, worth £36.00 a week. Universal Credit (UC) also includes a carer element worth £156.45 per monthly assessment period. Latest figures show that 6 out of ten households on UC with a Carer Entitlement recorded received a Monthly Award Amount of over £400: this is in addition to any CA they may receive. Receipt of means tested benefits can act as a “passport” to help with prescriptions and dental charges.\r\n \r\nFor carers not eligible for CA who are looking after sick or elderly family or friends, Carers Credit (CC) is a National Insurance Credit (not a benefit) which helps build qualifying years for State Pension purposes. To qualify for CC a person must be caring for one or more person for at least 20 hours a week, be over 16 years old but under State Pension age. The person being cared for must get either a qualifying benefit or be certified by a health or social care professional as needing the amount of care being provided. \r\n \r\nThe Government’s Fuller Working Lives Strategy sets out what the Government is doing to support carers who wish to remain in or return to work; as well as highlighting the sort of support that good employers should give carers in their workforce, such as flexible working. To spearhead some of this work the Government appointed the Business in the Community (BiTC) Age at Work leadership team as Business Champion for Older Workers. The Leadership Team spearhead the Government’s work to support employers to retain, retrain and recruit older workers. They actively promote the benefits of both employing and retaining older workers to employers across England – influencing them both strategically and in terms of practical advice. This work also benefits carers in the workplace.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions","created_at":"2018-08-21T15:58:33.305Z","updated_at":"2018-08-21T15:58:33.305Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":219279,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/219279.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Reintroduce full mortgage interest relief and drop the 3% stamp duty surcharge","background":"We call on the Government to reintroduce full mortgage interest relief and to drop the 3% stamp duty surcharge which is increasing homelessness by driving many landlords out of the sector, meaning tenants have less choice and higher rents.","additional_details":"There will still be a continuing growth in demand for housing and a significant part of this will have to be available through private landlords.

Neither measure is expected to impact rent levels","details":"The Government introduced changes to finance cost relief as part of a package of measures at Summer Budget 2015 to help reduce the deficit and rebalance the economy. By restricting landlord’s finance cost relief to the basic rate of income tax we are helping to reduce the advantage landlords may have over homeowners in the property market. Income tax relief for finance costs is not available to ordinary homebuyers. It is also not available to those investing in other assets, such as shares, so we’re helping to reduce the distortion between property investment and investment in other assets.\r\n\r\nPreviously, landlords could get relief on their finance costs at their marginal rate of income tax. By restricting finance cost relief to the basic rate, all individual landlords will receive the same rate of income tax relief on their finance costs. \r\nLandlords can still claim income tax relief at their marginal rate of tax on day-to-day running costs incurred in letting out a property, such as letting agent fees and replacing furniture. Finance costs are different to other expenses as having a mortgage allows the landlord to purchase a more expensive property and incur larger gains on the investment than they would have done without it.\r\n\r\nUsing actual self-assessment data, HMRC estimate that only 1 in 5 landlords will pay more tax on their property income because of this measure. We appreciate that some of these landlords may face difficult decisions. This is why the government has chosen to act in a proportionate and gradual way. Basic rate income tax relief will still be available on all landlord's finance costs, and the government announced this change almost two years before its implementation. The restriction, introduced in April 2017, is being phased in over 4 years. This gives landlords time to adjust to the changes.\r\n\r\nGiven that only a small proportion of the housing market is affected by this change, the government does not expect it to have a large impact on either house prices or rent levels. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) also expect the impact on the housing market will be small.\r\n \r\nIn April 2016, the Government introduced higher rates of Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) for those purchasing additional properties. While it is right that people should be free to purchase a second home or invest in a buy-to-let property, the Government is aware that this can impact on other people’s ability to get on to the property ladder. The higher rates are part of the Government’s commitment to support first time buyers. Since the higher rates have been introduced, over 500,000 people have bought their first home, and first-time buyers make up an increased share of the mortgaged property market. \r\n\r\nAt Autumn Budget 2017, the Government announced further changes to permanently increase the price at which a property becomes liable to SDLT to £300,000 for first time buyers, with first-time buyers purchasing homes worth between £300,000 and £500,000 saving £5,000. This relief means that 80% of first-time buyers will not pay SDLT, and 95% of first time buyers who pay SDLT will benefit from the change. Since its introduction, 69,000 people have benefited from the relief. Over the next five years, this relief will help over a million first time buyers getting onto the housing ladder.\r\n\r\nThe Government has also taken wider action on housing to help renters get a fair deal and to address homelessness and rough sleeping. At Autumn Budget 2017, the Government committed to £2 billion of extra funding for affordable housing, including for social rented homes, bringing total investment in the Affordable Homes Programme to more than £9 billion. The Government has also allocated over £1.2 billion by 2019/20 to help reduce and prevent homelessness and rough sleeping and is implementing the Homelessness Reduction Act, which will ensure that more people get the help they need earlier to prevent them from becoming homeless in the first place. The Government aims to halve rough sleeping by 2022 and eliminate it by 2027, and has set up a Rough Sleeping and Homelessness Reduction Taskforce to develop a cross-Government strategy to work towards this commitment.\r\n\r\nHM Treasury","created_at":"2018-05-25T10:24:32.059Z","updated_at":"2018-05-25T10:24:32.059Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":223567,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/223567.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Pay healthcare students a wage while on placement","background":"Although healthcare students receive supernumerary status while on placement, staff shortages and increased demand for healthcare dictates they are “hands on”.","additional_details":"Placement hours and unsociable shifts restrict students from taking on extra work to help with the cost of living.

Much of the investment is for research to better understand the nature of dementia, to inform development of future treatments and find ways to prevent the onset of the condition. \r\n\r\nWe are currently undertaking a Review of the Challenge on Dementia 2020 implementation plan which has been informed by a call for evidence which also asked stakeholder to consider what any potential next stage of the Challenge beyond 2020 should comprise.  We are considering all evidence submitted by stakeholders and other relevant evidence such as this petition in our Review of the Challenge on Dementia 2020. \r\n\r\nIn addition, the Challenge on Dementia 2020 committed to making dementia research a career opportunity of choice, with the UK being the best place to conduct dementia research. The Government has committed to invest £190m in the ground-breaking UK Dementia Research Institute (UKDRI) which will position the UK as a world leader in research in the biomedical causes of dementia as well as finding the best ways to improve care. In addition, the charities Alzheimer’s Society and Alzheimer’s Research UK have each pledged an additional £50m bringing total funding to £290 for the UKDRI.\r\n\r\nWe have invested £53 million in the Dementias Platform UK, a public-private partnership led by the Medical Research Council bringing together researchers from universities and industry to accelerate progress in dementia research in early detection, improved treatment and ultimately prevention.\r\n\r\nWe have invested over £40 million in the NIHR Dementias Translational Research Collaboration, which pulls discoveries from basic science into benefits for patients, offering partners in the life science industries a single point of access to research infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Health and Social Care co-founded the international Dementia Discovery Fund (DDF), contributing an initial £15 million. The DDF is the largest venture fund in the world focussed on a single disease area looking at discovering and developing novel pre-clinical therapies for dementia. \r\n\r\nIn June 2018 the DDF met its goal of raising a total of £250 million from a group of strategic investors committed to developing new medicines for dementia.\r\n\r\nThe Government has committed £98 million to a ‘Healthy Ageing’ challenge through the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund. £210 million has been made available for early diagnosis and £40 million for further research into dementia. This is in addition to the £300 million already pledged to dementia research by 2025.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care","created_at":"2018-10-25T11:16:39.123Z","updated_at":"2018-10-25T11:16:39.123Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":227134,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/227134.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Empower the UK Government or Parliament to regulate ferry prices.","background":"With current ferry prices being unregulated, companies are permitted to charge whatever they wish for crossings.

Ferry companies provide diverse services at a range of prices. There is no evidence of market failure to require regulatory intervention.","details":"Ferry companies in the UK operate in a competitive, commercial market, with the operators competing on price, quality, frequency and speed of their services. In locations such as the Isle of Wight there is a provision of frequent crossings, from a selection of locations, and at a range of prices. \r\n\r\nAt present such provision does not indicate evidence of a market failure or other reasons that may justify government regulatory intervention. As such the Government has no plans to regulate ferry prices. However, in circumstances where a commercially provided ferry link is at risk, Government would consider options to maintain that link as a lifeline service.\r\n\r\nUK ships and ports operate on a private basis, without public sector support, so the ferry companies concerned are private sector entities. The cost of a service, its quality, and frequency are therefore a commercial decision for the ferry operator, and for the company concerned to determine the commercial viability of differing service and fare levels in their current operating environment.\r\n\r\nThe exception to this is Scotland, where the Scottish Government subsidises, and also regulates fares for, a number of “lifeline” ferry services to connect remote and lightly populated locations that would not otherwise be commercially served due to a lack of demand. \r\n\r\nThis is not the case for the Isle of Wight where there are multiple operators providing up to approximately 250 sailings per day, and close to 100,000 scheduled sailings per year. Over 8.5 million passengers carried in 2017:  https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/sea-passenger-statistics-2017-short-sea-routes-provisional (Table SPAS0201) \r\n\r\nThe economic impact on the island and passengers using the ferry services has been considered on two occasions. Most recently the Isle of Wight Transport Infrastructure Task Force (TITF) was established in summer 2016 to receive information and make proposals on a wide range issues vital to the Island’s future. As part of this a report was produced - https://www.iow.gov.uk/azservices/documents/1190-TITF-Ferry-Assessment-FINAL.PDF that assessed whether there is any correlation between economic performance and trends in ferry operations.\r\n\r\nIt noted that Isle of Wight GVA has been higher, and more consistent than, that of its mainland neighbours and is comparable with wider trends. The report also found that the island economy is changing and economic growth is being achieved with less cross-Solent travel.\r\n\r\nIn 2009, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) investigated ferry services to and from the Isle of Wight, in particular whether there was a lack of competition, and if  prices were too high: http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140402181519/http://oft.gov.uk/shared_oft/consultations/oft1135.pdf .\r\n\r\nThe OFT decided not to refer the ferry companies to the then Competition Commission and concluded that there existed some features of the market that prevent, restrict or distort competition “but that there is limited evidence of actual consumer detriment”.\r\n\r\nAt an individual level, we can understand that the issue of ferry fares may have an influence on people’s travel choices, particularly for those making regular cross-Solent trips, travelling at short notice, or undertaking peak time travel. Evidence cited in the report to TITF noted that, while the ferry is an asset in terms of attracting visitors, a significant proportion of people have a poor opinion of the ferry services’ value for money. \r\n\r\nThe ferry companies do offer discounted fares for regular and special users, such as season or multibuy, as well as for medical travel, that can improve the value for money for individual customers.\r\n\r\nOverall, the two main reports produced on this issue do not indicate that there is a significant evidence of widespread economic or consumer impact. The available evidence at this time does not therefore support the regulation of ferry fares.\r\n\r\nThough the OFT did not refer the case to the Competition Commission it said that this should not constrain a future consideration of the market if that became necessary. In the case of a competition issue or market problem today, for example businesses abusing their dominant position, it is now the Competition and Markets Authority who will potentially have an interest. \r\n\r\nIt is open to anyone to complain to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), citing as much evidence as possible.  Whilst the CMA's predecessors did not find behaviour requiring action, evidence of a material change in recent years could be pertinent.  The CMA would then assess the case for further investigation depending on its current priorities and resources. The procedure for making complaints to the CMA can be found here: https://www.gov.uk/guidance/tell-the-cma-about-a-competition-or-market-problem \r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport.\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-12T10:59:07.733Z","updated_at":"2018-09-12T10:59:07.733Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":228814,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/228814.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Review the Animal Welfare Regulations 2018 and DEFRA Guidance notes","background":"New regulations for licensed activities involving animals are coming into force on October 1st.

It is a criminal offence for a person to belong to a proscribed organisation, invite support for a proscribed organisation, arrange a meeting in support of a proscribed organisation, or wear clothing or carry articles in public, which arouse reasonable suspicion that an individual is a member or supporter of a proscribed organisation. The penalties for proscription offences are a maximum of 10 years in prison and/or a fine.\r\n\r\nHizballah’s External Security Organisation (also known as the Military Wing) was proscribed by the UK Government in March 2001 and in 2008 the proscription was extended to Hizballah military apparatus including the Jihad Council.  Whilst the UK proscribes Hizballah’s military wing, we do not proscribe the group in its entirety. Proscription is an important, but not the only, part of the Government’s strategy to disrupt the activities of terrorist groups and those who provide support to them.  \r\n\r\nHizballah’s military wing is also designated in the UK under the Terrorist Asset-Freezing Act 2010. Therefore, funds or economic resources owned, held or controlled by Hizballah’s military wing in the UK can be frozen.  In July 2012, following the Burgas bombing, the EU also designated Hizballah’s military wing as a terrorist organisation under the EU asset freeze regime.\r\n\r\nThe current proscription and asset freeze already sends a clear message that we condemn Hizballah’s violence and support for terrorism. Groups are not free to spread hatred, fund terrorist activity or incite violence as they please, irrespective of whether they are included on the list of proscribed organisations or not.  \r\n\r\nThe flag for the organisation’s military wing is the same as the flag for its political wing. Therefore for it to be an offence for an individual to display the flags for this organisation the context and manner in which the flag is displayed must demonstrate that it is specifically in support of the proscribed elements of the group.\r\n\r\nPeaceful protest is a vital part of a democratic society and it is a long-standing tradition in this country that people are free to gather together and to demonstrate their views, however uncomfortable these may be to the majority of us, provided that they do so lawfully.  There is, of course, a balance to be struck.  Protesters’ rights need to be balanced with the rights of others to go about their business without fear of intimidation or serious disruption to the community.  Rights to peaceful protest do not extend to violent or threatening behaviour and the police have powers to deal with any such acts. The management of protests is of course a matter for the police.  Similarly, the investigation and prosecution of all criminal offences is a matter for the police, together with the Crown Prosecution Service.  \r\n\r\nThe UK Government condemns any language or act which attempts to delegitimise the State of Israel, and also hate crime of any kind, directed against any community, race or religion, which has absolutely no place in our society. Violence against anyone in this country is a crime and will be treated seriously. To reiterate, inciting hatred or racial abuse is still an offence regardless of whether an individual is a member of an organisation, even if that organisation is not proscribed in the UK.  \r\n\r\nThe Government acknowledges the request to extend the proscription of Hizballah to cover the group’s political wing, however, whilst the list of proscribed groups is kept under review, the Government does not routinely comment on whether an organisation is or is not under consideration for proscription.\r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2018-06-15T15:28:54.406Z","updated_at":"2018-06-15T15:28:54.406Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":227209,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/227209.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Summon the Dutch ambassador to protest about the “Draw Muhammad” competition.","background":"For a Muslim, the respect and honour of Prophet Muhammad (Peace and Blessings be upon him) is above all else.\r\n \r\n\r\n","additional_details":"The drawing of any cartoon or image of the Blessed Prophet is deeply offensive.

In addition, Lord Ashcroft’s Veterans’ Transition Review (2014) found that service leavers are no more likely to commit suicide than the rest of the population. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, the Government’s National Suicide Prevention Strategy includes veterans as a group requiring tailored approaches to meet their mental health needs to reduce their risk of suicide. In 2017, NHS England launched Transition, Intervention and Liaison services, which increase access and treatment to appropriate and timely mental health services for both serving Armed Forces personnel approaching discharge and veterans with mental health difficulties. This is complemented by the launch of NHS England’s Veterans’ Mental Health Complex Treatment Service in April 2018, which provides an enhanced service for veterans who have military attributable complex mental health problems that were not resolved earlier in the care/support pathway.  \r\n\r\nVeterans can also access support services from: www.gov.uk/mental-health-support-for-the-uk-armed-forces, call the 24-hour veterans' mental health helpline on 0800 138 1619 or access the Veterans Gateway: https://www.veteransgateway.org.uk/.\r\n\r\nIn addition, almost every local authority in England has a multi-agency suicide prevention plan in place so that all services who come into contact with people at risk of suicide work together to implement tailored approaches to reducing suicides in their communities. \r\n\r\nBuilding on this work, in May 2018 NHS England, Public Health England and the Department of Health and Social Care launched the first year of a three year programme to support suicide prevention, allocating funds to eight sustainability and transformation partnerships with the highest suicide rates, or significantly high rates in men (press release and details here: https://www.england.nhs.uk/2018/05/suicide-prevention-and-reduction/) \r\n\r\nThe Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and the Coroners Service for Northern Ireland are responsible for the investigation of sudden and unexplained deaths in Scotland and Northern Ireland respectively.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Justice.\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-05T09:29:21.816Z","updated_at":"2018-09-05T09:29:21.816Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":226446,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/226446.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Revoke the BBC's Royal Charter.","background":"The BBC has a Charter obligation to be independent in fulfilment of its mission.

The establishment of the current Charter was an extensive process of consultation and evidence gathering, with 192,000 responses to the public consultation and engagement with over 300 organisations and industry experts. \r\n\r\nThe BBC is operationally and editorially independent of government and there is no provision for the government to intervene in the BBC’s day-to-day operations. Independence and impartiality are embedded in the Charter and the BBC’s public purposes.  The BBC Board is responsible for ensuring the BBC delivers its Charter obligations, including its mission and public purposes. The BBC Board is also responsible for ensuring the BBC adheres to its editorial guidelines. As the external independent regulator of the BBC, it is Ofcom’s responsibility to hold the BBC to account in fulfilling its mission and public purposes. Alongside this, the Ofcom Broadcasting Code requires all broadcasters, including the BBC, to report and present news with due accuracy and impartiality.  \r\n\r\nWe considered the question of funding during the BBC Charter Review process. While no funding model meets all the criteria of an ideal system, the current model provides the BBC with a sustainable core income paid by all households that watch or receive television. This model also has wider public support than any alternative - 60% of consultation responses indicated that no change was needed to the current licence fee model, and only 3% favoured full subscription funding. That is why we have committed to maintain the licence fee funding model for the BBC for the duration of this current 11 year Charter period.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","created_at":"2018-09-20T11:10:09.086Z","updated_at":"2018-09-20T11:10:09.086Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":218095,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/218095.json"},"attributes":{"action":"To make the Military Covenant legal and into Law","background":"Our service personnel are being let down by our Government with their failure to live up to the Military Covenant, this is because it has no legal standing although the term \"covenant\" implies some form of legal guarantee or contract.

The Government has a statutory requirement to report annually to Parliament on its progress in delivering against the Covenant.","details":"The Armed Forces Covenant (“the Covenant”) is a promise by the nation that the Armed Forces community (serving personnel, veterans, and their families) should not be disadvantaged in accessing public and private goods and services as a result of their service and that special provision should be made for those who have sacrificed the most, including the injured and the bereaved.\r\n\r\nEnshrined in the 2011 Armed Forces Act, the Covenant applies across the UK. The Government (HMG) has a statutory requirement to report annually to Parliament on its progress in upholding the Covenant. These reports include a growing list of objective performance measures and the independent observations of the Service charities and the Families Federations to hold HMG to account.\r\n\r\nSince 2011 much has been achieved and more remains to be done.  The Covenant is embedded in the NHS constitution and awareness in healthcare professionals of issues faced by the Armed Forces community is improving -  the Covenant now forms part of the Royal College of GPs’ membership exam.  Access to specialist prosthetics treatments and to mental healthcare services has improved significantly, following the launch of the Transition, Intervention and Liaison Services, and Complex Treatment Service. In England, the Service Pupil Premium has provided funding to mitigate the impact of Service life on children’s education and from September, more detail will be available to teachers via the Common Transfer File on Service children’s educational needs and family circumstances.  Young Service families are being helped onto the property ladder with the Forces Help to Buy scheme which has awarded £215 million (circa £15,000 per claim) to around 14,300 successful applicants since April 2014.  While there is a great deal of support available, those who need it are not always aware of how to access it. The Covenant-funded Veterans Gateway looks to address this by providing a single point of contact and signposting veterans to the most appropriate source of support; to date 8,486 veterans have contacted the service.\r\n\r\nAll 407 Local Authorities (LAs) in GB have signed the Covenant, with bespoke arrangements in Northern Ireland. Guidance is available to LAs on how they can most effectively support their Service populations; including using the £10 million per annum Covenant Fund to build local partnerships between the Armed Forces and the wider community.\r\n  \r\nThe partnership theme is also resonating in the private sector where support for the Covenant is growing rapidly, with more than 2,500 signatories. Companies are pledging support to veterans, reservists and military spouses by offering flexible HR policies and acknowledging the skills learnt during time in the Services. Further success has been achieved commercially, with companies agreeing to waive cancellation fees on media packages for those posted at short notice and mortgage providers exempting Service personnel from higher rate buy-to-let mortgage products.\r\n\r\nWhen there is a need to legislate, then we will do so, for example the Armed Forces (Flexible Working) Act 2018 reflects the demands of modern family life by providing more flexible working opportunities, in acknowledgement of the desire of Service personnel to have more control over their careers and how they live. Another example is HMG’s new statutory requirement, due to come into effect this autumn, to refer Service leavers at risk of homelessness to the relevant LA. Targeting specific issues in this way is the most effective means of mitigating disadvantage.\r\n\r\nHMG’s commitment to the Covenant was reinforced in 2017 with the creation of the Ministerial Covenant and Veterans Board, strengthening delivery of the Covenant across government. Every Department on the Board has appointed a lead Minister for Covenant issues. The Board is also overseeing a veterans’ strategy which will review current provision for veterans across the UK and make its recommendations before the end of the year. As part of this work, the MOD is also developing a new transition policy to provide more comprehensive support to Service families as they transition to civilian life, including advice and support on housing matters.\r\n\r\nIt is HMG’s view that much of what the Covenant has achieved so far stems from its voluntary nature.  It is a pact between the Armed Forces community and the nation in acknowledgment of the sacrifices they have made.  The nation honours this pact because it is the right thing to do, not because they are obliged to do so.  \r\n\r\nUseful links:\r\nForces Help to Buy statistics\r\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/701878/FHTB_Official_Statistics_Q4_201718.pdf\r\nVeterans Gateway\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/veterans-gateway\r\n\r\nGuidance for local authorities\r\nhttps://www.armedforcescovenant.gov.uk/localauthorities/\r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence","created_at":"2018-05-31T12:39:19.662Z","updated_at":"2018-06-01T13:34:49.113Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":220172,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/220172.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Keep the rights of EU27 + EFTA citizens already in the UK unchanged after Brexit","background":"Before the EU referendum Vote Leave said: “There will be no change for EU citizens already lawfully resident in the UK.

We have reached an agreement with the EU on the rights of EU citizens living in the UK, as set out in the draft legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement. The agreement confirms that all EU citizens legally resident in the UK by December 2020 will be able to continue living their lives broadly as now. It will enable families who have built their lives together in the UK and EU to stay together. It also gives people more certainty about residency, healthcare, pensions and other benefits. \r\n\r\nThe UK is implementing this agreement through the EU Settlement Scheme and the granting of settled status. EU citizens and their family members who obtain settled status will be granted indefinite leave to remain (ILR) in the UK. \r\n\r\nWe have agreed that those granted settled status (ILR) in line with the Withdrawal Agreement can also benefit from certain more favourable entitlements, with regard to their residence status. This means, for example, that their settled status will not lapse unless the holder has been absent from the UK for more than five consecutive years, as opposed to the usual two years under EU law. EU citizens will also be able to be joined by close family members after the end of the implementation period (where the relationship existed on 31 December 2020 and still exists when the person wishes to come to the UK).\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Withdrawal Agreement will ensure equal treatment to UK nationals with respect to social security, social assistance, health care, employment and self-employment, education and training, and tax.\r\n\r\nIn the UK, the Withdrawal Agreement will be fully incorporated into UK law, meaning EU citizens will be able to rely directly on the terms of the Agreement in UK courts. UK courts will be able to ask the CJEU questions on specific points of law in relation to citizens’ rights, having had due regard to whether relevant case law exists, but it will be for our courts to make final judgments. This voluntary reference procedure is time-limited: UK courts will be able to refer questions that relate to settled status to the CJEU for eight years from exit day and other aspects of the Citizens’ Rights part of the agreement for eight years from the end of the implementation period. The UK will also be establishing an Independent Monitoring Authority (IMA) to monitor how the agreement is implemented in the UK, to ensure that the citizens’ rights agreement is faithfully implemented, and to provide additional assurance for EU citizens\r\nliving in the UK. The IMA will have the power to receive complaints from citizens and take appropriate action if they believe there has been a failure on the part of the authorities to implement the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement.\r\n\r\nThe Government was clear from the start of withdrawal negotiations that EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU should have their voting and candidacy rights protected. We are disappointed that the EU was unwilling to match our position and protect these rights in the Withdrawal Agreement. We will look to explore bilateral arrangements on voting rights with Member States that do not already provide for this in their national law. \r\n\r\nThe EU deal will not cover EFTA (European Free Trade Association) nationals, as they are not EU nationals. We are in discussions with the EEA EFTA states (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and Switzerland on agreements to protect the rights of UK nationals living in those countries and their nationals living in the UK. The Government intends that the settlement scheme (described in the Home Office’s Statement of Intent) will be open to other EEA citizens and Swiss citizens (and their family members) on a similar basis as for EU citizens.  \r\n\r\nDepartment for Exiting the European Union.\r\n\r\n","created_at":"2018-09-17T10:19:44.602Z","updated_at":"2018-09-17T10:20:08.141Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":225025,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/225025.json"},"attributes":{"action":"The UK government should ban Steve Bannon from entering the UK","background":"Steve Bannon is a far-right political figure who poses a direct risk to the security of the UK.

However, the Government does take seriously the concerns shared about NHS Trusts allowing commercial representatives to approach new mothers in maternity wards shortly after they have given birth. New parents have a right to dignity and to feel safe and comfortable on NHS wards. This is particularly true for women in the period after giving birth when they may feel especially vulnerable.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) maternity inspection framework was updated to include lines of enquiry about the processes that Trusts have in place regarding the access of commercial representatives on postnatal wards. It is for individual trusts to make decisions about allowing commercial representatives access to postnatal wards.  However, as with all hospital visitors, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) expects trusts to have robust procedures in place to ensure that all representatives respect the privacy and dignity of all women and their families. \r\n\r\nAny commercial representatives speaking to patients within an NHS ward should provide clear information about how patient data will be used and ensure that they are operating in compliance of the Data Protection Act 2018. This is a matter for each individual Trust to consider, in line with their local practices.  Over the last year DHSC has been working alongside system partners within a National General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) Working Group to develop a comprehensive suite of guidance products to help organisations recognise their obligations, and put effective governance and risk management arrangements in place across health and social care. These are published on the NHS Digital website on a dedicated GDPR portal. This website can be accessed via the following link: \r\nhttps://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/looking-after-information/data-security-and-information-governance/information-governance-alliance-iga/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-guidance. \r\n\r\nIt is for individual organisations to take account of these guidance products when developing their own policies and risk management practices.\r\n\r\nIpswich hospital has introduced a system where mothers are only approached by a commercial representative if they indicate that this is something that they would like. Mothers can show their preference by placing a card on their bedside table. This is a good example of how Trusts can put processes in place to give new mothers clear control over their interaction with commercial representatives. The Government is considering how to clarify guidance, so that that the interaction between commercial representatives and new mothers on NHS wards is consistently more positive across the UK.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-25T16:10:22.616Z","updated_at":"2018-10-25T16:10:22.616Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":226054,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/226054.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Declare a Climate Emergency, end fossil fuel use and build community resilience.","background":"The current wave of extreme weather around the globe and in Britain indicates that the climate emergency predicted by our scientists is now here.
