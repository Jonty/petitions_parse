But, although it is good, it's not good enough. There are still people smoking and affecting not only their own health but those around them. 78,000 people in the UK a year are still dying from smoking.\r\n\r\nAnd, besides, not many people like breathing in the terrible smoke cigarettes produce. So, if you want to make our air cleaner and save 78,000 lives a year, sign this petition.","state":"open","signature_count":10,"created_at":"2017-11-10T15:57:32.709Z","updated_at":"2018-12-19T07:07:00.184Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-11-26T10:44:30.415Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-11-10T08:03:11.741Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Calum Childs","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":235299,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/235299.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Clarity on the conditions in which Sec. of State for NI would call a border poll","background":"In absence of clarity in the Good Friday Belfast agreement, I wish to request the Secretary of state for NI clarify the conditions that must be met to call a border poll on Irish reunification.","additional_details":"","state":"open","signature_count":9,"created_at":"2018-12-15T14:09:36.698Z","updated_at":"2018-12-20T21:42:46.855Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-12-20T13:13:46.927Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-12-15T15:44:20.545Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Liam Clarke","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":235022,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/235022.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Introduce paid bereavement leave as an employment right","background":"Losing a loved one is traumatic, stressful \u0026 demanding, but there is no legal requirement for employers to provide paid bereavement leave.","additional_details":"Introduce paid bereavement leave as an employment right\r\nLosing a loved one is traumatic, stressful \u0026 demanding, but there is no legal requirement for employers to provide paid bereavement leave.\r\n\r\nThis means employers can force people to immediately return to work or go unpaid/use their holiday, which is unacceptable \u0026 counter-productive for well-being.","state":"open","signature_count":9,"created_at":"2018-12-12T01:18:29.442Z","updated_at":"2018-12-18T11:30:28.659Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-12-18T11:30:27.015Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-12-12T14:41:02.524Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Michael Ollerton","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":234712,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/234712.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make it a UK law for premises selling food or drink to hold EpiPens","background":"Allergies are on the rise in the UK and there are an increasing amount of stories of people who have suffered severely or even died from the unawareness and ignorance surrounding food allergies.
