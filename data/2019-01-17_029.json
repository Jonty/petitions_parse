As parents and carers we have a duty to our children.\r\n\r\nThe petition is aimed to try to implement a law that states that no child under the age of 13 should be left alone at any given time, the reason for this is due to safeguarding and putting a huge responsibility on children regardless of their mental age. We are not allowed to leave children alone overnight and the same rules must apply throughout the day too. I understand a child must be given due responsibility but under the age of 13 should not be allowed due to risks and safety.","state":"open","signature_count":11,"created_at":"2018-10-05T21:03:06.130Z","updated_at":"2018-11-20T11:53:18.565Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-10-15T16:14:06.141Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-10-06T17:14:18.947Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Paul Hulse","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":229452,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/229452.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Urge Bank of England to return to traditional 'paper' banknotes","background":"Keep existing 'paper* £20 \u0026 £50 and recall existing polymer notes.

After this experience, we decided we were going to try and make a difference by starting this petition.","state":"open","signature_count":11,"created_at":"2018-07-21T11:20:12.208Z","updated_at":"2018-10-24T22:25:45.056Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-07-31T09:54:19.009Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-07-23T14:32:34.026Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Freya Smith","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":222589,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/222589.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Stop Water companies from draining UK taxable profits by ‘Earnings Stripping’","background":"Utilities companies’ taxable profits are being drained by large foreign-owned multinationals.
