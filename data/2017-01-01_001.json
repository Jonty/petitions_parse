It protects both privacy and security and underwent unprecedented scrutiny before becoming law.","details":"The Government is clear that, at a time of heightened security threat, it is essential our law enforcement, security and intelligence services have the powers they need to keep people safe.\r\n\r\nThe Investigatory Powers Act transforms the law relating to the use and oversight of Investigatory powers. It strengthens safeguards and introduces world-leading oversight arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe Act does three key things. First, it brings together powers already available to law enforcement and the security and intelligence agencies to obtain communications and data about communications. It makes these powers – and the safeguards that apply to them – clear and understandable.\r\n\r\nSecond, it radically overhauls the way these powers are authorised and overseen. It introduces a ‘double-lock’ for the most intrusive powers, including interception and all of the bulk capabilities, so warrants require the approval of a Judicial Commissioner. And it creates a powerful new Investigatory Powers Commissioner to oversee how these powers are used.\r\n\r\nThird, it ensures powers are fit for the digital age. The Act makes a single new provision for the retention of internet connection records in order for law enforcement to identify the communications service to which a device has connected. This will restore capabilities that have been lost as a result of changes in the way people communicate.\r\n\r\nPublic scrutiny\r\n\r\nThe Bill was subject to unprecedented scrutiny prior to and during its passage.\r\nThe Bill responded to three independent reports: by David Anderson QC, the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation; by the Royal United Services Institute’s Independent Surveillance Review Panel; and by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament. All three of those authoritative independent reports agreed a new law was needed.\r\n \r\nThe Government responded to the recommendations of those reports in the form of a draft Bill, published in November 2015. That draft Bill was submitted for pre-legislative scrutiny by a Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament. The Intelligence and Security Committee and the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee conducted parallel scrutiny. Between them, those Committees received over 1,500 pages of written submissions and heard oral evidence from the Government, industry, civil liberties groups and many others. The recommendations made by those Committees informed changes to the Bill and the publication of further supporting material.\r\n\r\nA revised Bill was introduced in the House of Commons on 1 March, and completed its passage on 16 November, meeting the timetable for legislation set by Parliament during the passage of the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014. Over 1,700 amendments to the Bill were tabled and debated during this time. \r\n\r\nThe Government has adopted an open and consultative approach throughout the passage of this legislation, tabling or accepting a significant number of amendments in both Houses of Parliament in order to improve transparency and strengthen privacy protections. These included enhanced protections for trade unions and journalistic and legally privileged material, and the introduction of a threshold to ensure internet connection records cannot be used to investigate minor crimes. \r\n\r\nPrivacy and Oversight\r\n\r\nThe Government has placed privacy at the heart of the Investigatory Powers Act. The Act makes clear the extent to which investigatory powers may be used and the strict safeguards that apply in order to maintain privacy. \r\n\r\nA new overarching ‘privacy clause’ was added to make absolutely clear that the protection of privacy is at the heart of this legislation. This privacy clause ensures that in each and every case a public authority must consider whether less intrusive means could be used, and must have regard to human rights and the particular sensitivity of certain information. The powers can only be exercised when it is necessary and proportionate to do so, and the Act includes tough sanctions – including the creation of new criminal offences – for those misusing the powers.\r\nThe safeguards in this Act reflect the UK’s international reputation for protecting human rights. The unprecedented transparency and the new safeguards – including the ‘double lock’ for the most sensitive powers – set an international benchmark for how the law can protect both privacy and security.\r\n \r\nHome Office","created_at":"2016-11-29T12:00:09.557Z","updated_at":"2016-11-29T12:00:09.557Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":null,"transcript_url":"","video_url":"","overview":"The Petitions Committee has decided not to schedule a debate on this petition.

Legislation restricts the sale of fireworks and controls their use, and we have no plans to extend this further.","details":"The government recognises the concerns raised about the use of fireworks by the public, particularly the potential distress caused by the use of noisy fireworks to pets, livestock and the public, and injuries caused by accidents and the misuse of fireworks.\r\n\r\nMany individuals enjoy being able to hold private fireworks displays at home, and have a sensible and responsible attitude to their use.  Indeed, the majority of the public who use fireworks do so in a safe and considerate way; it is only an anti-social minority that uses them dangerously and inconsiderately. \r\n\r\nWhile members of the public can hold private firework displays at any time of the year, they are subject to strict curfews which prevent fireworks being used after 11pm, except on a limited number of specific nights of the year around the traditional celebrations of 5th November, New Year, Chinese New Year and Diwali when they can be used up to midnight (5th November) or 1am (New Year, Chinese New Year and Diwali). \r\n\r\nRetailers are restricted to selling fireworks for limited periods around these four traditional occasions, unless they have a valid licence specifically allowing all year round sales.\r\n\r\nThere is maximum noise level of 120 decibels on fireworks sold to the public, and local authorities have powers to deal with excessive firework noise.  There is also a prohibition on setting off fireworks in a public place, enforceable by the police with tough sanctions for non-compliance.\r\n\r\nThere is government-sponsored advice and guidance to support the responsible and considerate use of fireworks on the Safer Fireworks website.  \r\n\r\nWhile any firework-related injury is a cause for concern, the number of injuries are significantly lower than suggested.  Furthermore, the latest official statistics, demonstrate that there is a downward trend in hospital admissions in England (arising from the discharge of fireworks) with 28% decrease between 2010 and 2014/15, when there were 114 admissions.\r\n\r\nThe government will continue to focus on reducing accidents and nuisance by encouraging industry, retailers and others to promote responsible use through guidance and public education.  We urge those using fireworks to be considerate to their neighbours and give sufficient notice of firework use, particularly where they are proposing to let off fireworks in the vicinity of animals, especially livestock, where they should notify owners of livestock nearby of their plans.\r\n\r\nThe government considers these controls effectively manage and reduce the level of risk posed by the public use of fireworks, and that to bring in further restrictions would be detrimental to an important British tradition reflecting our history and multi-culturalism.  There are no plans at the moment to place further limitations on their use.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy ","created_at":"2016-11-14T11:25:55.088Z","updated_at":"2016-11-14T11:25:55.088Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":null,"transcript_url":"","video_url":"","overview":"The Petitions Committee has decided not to schedule a debate on this petition.

","details":"The Government is aware that the cost of motor insurance can be high for new and inexperienced drivers. We have taken forward a programme of measures to strengthen the way that people learn to drive and are tested.  We have engaged insurers in this process, so that they can have confidence that additional measures will make a real difference that can be rewarded with lower premiums.  \r\n\r\nMotor insurance premiums can vary according to the risks associated with different types of driver, vehicle and other factors such as age and driving experience.   Motor insurance is a very competitive market and shopping around for the best possible option before making any decisions is likely to benefit customers.  The British Insurance Brokers Association (BIBA) run a not for profit ‘find a broker’ service where there are many broker products for young drivers. Further information can be found on their website: www.biba.org.uk. New rules coming into force next year will require motor insurers to disclose last year’s premium at renewal and prompt customers to shop around for the best deal.\r\n\r\nSome insurers have introduced the use of telematics or in-car black boxes to allow better risk-based pricing for new drivers. It means insurers now have a real time data feed, which allows them to see an individual’s driving behaviour, which had not previously been possible in the past. There is some evidence that suggests new drivers could see their annual premiums fall by 20% or more if they show good driving behaviour with a black box installed in their cars. \r\n\r\nThe Government recently announced reforms aimed at tackling the continuing high number and costly whiplash injury claims that were having a negative impact on the price of motor insurance premiums.  These reforms will end the cycle in which motorists pay higher insurance premiums due to minor, exaggerated and fraudulent whiplash claims by others.   The government fully expects insurers to pass on the savings from these reforms to consumers through lower premiums and leading insurers have already committed to do this. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport","created_at":"2016-12-13T09:14:32.035Z","updated_at":"2016-12-13T09:14:32.035Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":168524,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/168524.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Close all retail on boxing day, retail isn't needed on boxing day!","background":"Christmas is a family time, the one day is not enough time to see two sides of families, retail workers work extremely hard during the Christmas run up and only get the one day.

Therefore we are not proposing to ban shops from opening on Boxing Day. ","details":"The Importance of the Retail sector and its employees\r\n\r\nThe Government recognises the importance of retail to national and local economies.  It employs 3 million people and the sector generated £90 billion of Gross Value Added in 2014, 5.6% of the UK economy and 4% higher than in 2013.\r\n\r\nThe Government also believes that all workers, including those in retail, should have access to employment rights and protections.  The Government’s website, GOV.UK, provides detailed and accessible advice on all aspects of employment, including what to do in case of a dispute.\r\n\r\nRetail opening hours\r\n\r\nThere are no controls on shops’ opening hours on Boxing Day, unless it falls on a Sunday. The Sunday Trading Act 1994 limits the opening hours of large stores in England and Wales (i.e. those with a trading area over 280 square metres / 3,000 square feet) to 6 continuous hours (between 10am and 6pm) on a Sunday and not at all on Easter Sunday. The Christmas Day Trading Act 2004 prohibits large shops from opening on Christmas Day whatever day of the week it falls. Similar legislation applies in Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the internet has changed consumers’ shopping habits radically and many have got used to the freedom to buy what they need at any time that suits them. Online businesses and smaller retailers already have the flexibility to respond to this demand. Billions of pounds are spent by millions of shoppers on Boxing Day and it is also a busy day for internet sales. The Government believes that all businesses should be allowed flexibility to meet their customers’ needs and offer consumers choice about when and how they want to shop. This will help drive competition, productivity and the local economy, as well as helping create jobs.\r\n\r\nIn this internet age, the Government aims to support local high streets to remain at the heart of our communities by being vibrant and viable places where people live, shop, use services and spend their leisure time, both during the day and evening. \r\n\r\nBoxing Day, Bank Holidays and Working Hours\r\n\r\nThe Government believes that the current regulatory situation represents a fair balance between the interests of employers and workers. \r\n\r\nUnder the relevant legislation (the Working Time Regulations or WTRs), workers do not have a statutory entitlement to time off on Bank Holidays.  However employers may allow workers to take time off on those days.\r\n\r\nWorkers have many protections under the WTR, including\r\n•\tA statutory annual leave entitlement of 5.6 weeks (subject to a limit of 28 days)\r\n•\tA maximum working week of 48 hours, normally averaged over 17 weeks (however workers can choose to opt-out of the 48 hour limit)\r\n•\tEntitlements to rest breaks, and daily and weekly rest periods\r\n\r\nYoung workers and night workers are entitled to additional protections.\r\n\r\nIf workers are unhappy with any aspects of their working conditions, they can contact the ACAS helpline for free and confidential advice on 0300 123 1100, or consult the ACAS website at www.acas.org.uk. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy","created_at":"2016-11-22T14:00:43.918Z","updated_at":"2016-11-22T14:00:43.918Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":"2016-12-12","transcript_url":"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2016-12-12/debates/11A5F923-B176-464D-8C10-6DAEBB4A3F30/RetailStoreClosureBoxingDay","video_url":"http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/8ebf30b5-6d08-4c20-9978-836afc010c65","overview":""}}},{"type":"petition","id":173574,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/173574.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Air-drop life saving aid into the starving cities in Syria.","background":"As you may be aware, the situation in Syria has become critical this week.

We recognise and are grateful for the bravery and skills shown by police dogs and their handlers day in and day out.\r\n\r\nThe Government agrees that attacks of any sort on police dogs or horses are unacceptable and should be dealt with severely under the criminal law. The law already allows for significant penalties to be issued to those who attack animals that support the police. An attack on a police dog or other police support animal can be treated as causing unnecessary suffering to an animal under section 4 of the Animal Welfare Act 2006. The maximum penalty is 6 months’ imprisonment, or an unlimited fine, or both. The financial element of the penalty was raised only last year from a maximum fine of £20,000. An attack on a police animal could be considered by the court as an aggravating factor leading to a higher sentence within the available range. Under some circumstances assaults on support animals could be treated as criminal damage which would allow for penalties of up to 10 years’ imprisonment.  \r\n\r\nWhilst police leaders and campaigners agree that these penalties are appropriate, I understand that it is unpalatable to think of police animals as ‘equipment’ as is inferred by the charges of criminal damage.  This does not seem to convey the respect and gratitude police and public feel for the animals involved and their contribution to law enforcement and public safety. The Government has therefore agreed to explore whether there is more that the law should do to offer the most appropriate protections to police animals and all working animals.  \r\n\r\nWhen sentencing for offences of cruelty to or neglect of animals it is for the courts to decide on an appropriate penalty based on the individual circumstances of each case. Magistrates are provided with guidelines by the Sentencing Council to help them impose appropriate sentences and penalties. The guidelines give examples of offences, aggravating and mitigating factors, as well as the range of suggested sentences and penalties for various types of offences.  The Government has requested that the Sentencing Council considers assaults on police animals as an aggravating factor as a part of their current review on guidelines for sentencing in the Magistrates’ Courts, which includes animal cruelty offences.\r\n\r\nThe Government will continue to work with the police to understand the extent of this problem.  Officials will be meeting national policing leads for police animals to discuss this issue over the coming weeks.

The independent Cancer Taskforce’s five-year strategy for cancer, Achieving World-Class Cancer Outcomes: A Strategy for England 2015-2020 (July 2015), recommends improvements across the cancer pathway with the aim of improving survival rates, awareness and the quality of care people receive. \r\n\r\nCancer services for children, teenagers and young adults (CTYA) have improved significantly and the NHS needs to consider the best structure for continued improved care and experience. The strategy has a number of recommendations with implications for CTYA as well as the following specific recommendations:\r\n\r\n•\t43: looks at a possible review of CTYA services to provide improved integrated care \r\n•\t44: consent from children and young people for their data and tissue collection for use in future research studies and development of services, and \r\n•\t45: that NHS England, National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) and cancer research charities to consider ways in which access to clinical trials for teenagers and young adults with cancer could be significantly increased. \r\n\r\nAn implementation plan Achieving World-Class Cancer Outcomes: Taking the strategy forward, was published May 2016 and the Board published its first annual progress report in October 2016. \r\n\r\nNHS England already has the funds necessary to improve cancer services over the next five years as part of commitments in the Mandate and the additional £10 billion of funding.  The recommendations in the independent Cancer Taskforce’s report give direction as to where these funds should be targeted to achieve world-class cancer outcomes.\r\n\r\nInvestment in cancer research by the NIHR has increased substantially from £101 million in 2010/11 to £142 million in 2015/16 including research relating to childhood cancers. A new Department of Health Task and Finish Working Group on Brain Tumour Research is bringing together clinicians, charities and officials to discuss how, working together with research funding partners, we can increase the level and impact of research into brain tumours, including those in children. The Working Group, chaired by Professor Chris Whitty, the Department’s Chief Scientific Adviser first met October 2016 and the Government expects it will complete its tasks by September 2017.\r\n\r\n•\tThrough the establishment of the 100,000 Genomes Project, the UK continues to be world leader in using genomics to diagnose, treat and prevent rare disease and cancer.\r\n\r\n•\tThe project currently covers 193 rare disease categories including childhood cancers. \r\n\r\n•\tConsiderable investment has been made in the project to date including £350 million from DH via the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) budget.\r\n\r\n•\tThe project is already providing answers and changing lives - the first children with a rare disease have received diagnoses through the project at Great Ormond Street Hospital.\r\n\r\n•\tThe UK Strategy for Rare Diseases, published in November 2013, sets out a strategic vision for improving the lives of all those affected by rare diseases. It contains 51 commitments to be implemented by 2020 and has been signed up to by the four countries of the UK.\r\n\r\n•\tThe UK has also been at the forefront of pan-EU action on rare diseases. The 2011 EU Cross-Border Healthcare Directive promotes European Reference Networks (ERNs) as centres of knowledge, skills and expertise.\r\n\r\nWe know that cancer can affect all areas of a person’s life, including relationships, work, and finances – 83% of people say they are financially impacted by cancer. People require holistic support from diagnosis onwards, encompassing their physical, financial, psychosocial, and information and support needs, throughout their entire cancer journey. \r\n\r\nAs can be seen in the case of Poppy-Mai, a cancer diagnosis can have devastating consequences for the lives of young people and their families, and we are working hard to improve services for patients in England within the constraints of the resources available to the NHS.  Care should be built around what matters to the young person and their family and carers so we are working closely with cancer charities to ensure patients get the support they need during and after their treatment. \r\n\r\nThe hospital travel costs scheme provides financial assistance to those patients who do not have a medical need for ambulance transport, but need assistance with travel costs. This is part of the well-established NHS Low Income Scheme, in which patients on low incomes or receiving specific qualifying benefits or allowances can be reimbursed in part or in full for travelling costs to receive treatment at hospitals including cancer treatment. It also can be claimed where the appointment has been made for a child. \r\n\r\nChildren and teenagers with serious or critical illnesses such as cancer are also entitled to apply for Disability Living Allowance or DLA (or a Personal Independence Payment if over 16).\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2016-11-22T16:07:16.666Z","updated_at":"2016-11-22T16:13:25.251Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":"2016-11-28","transcript_url":"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2016-11-28/debates/712C7DA1-FBB4-4D7B-BB01-BDB78C66AB89/ChildCancer","video_url":"http://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/eac0e840-b934-48c7-87d3-41432f643ae5","overview":""}}},{"type":"petition","id":165905,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/165905.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Shut down the domestic ivory market in the UK.","background":"The Conservatives pledged to shut down the UK’s domestic ivory market in their manifesto for the past two elections. 30,000 African Elephants are slaughtered a year for their tusks yet, the government has still not outlawed the trade.

","details":"NHS staff are our greatest asset. Despite the pressures on the NHS driven by an increasingly aged and frail population, nurses, and all our hard working NHS staff continue to put patients first, keeping them safe whilst providing the high quality care patients and their families expect.\r\n\r\nThe Government has protected NHS front line funding whilst increasing staffing levels with over 3,500 more nurses and midwives employed since May 2010 and over 51,000 nurses currently in training.\r\n\r\nHealth Education England, NHS England and the Department have taken a range of actions to boost the supply of domestically trained staff and to increase the efficiency and productivity of the existing workforce.  The NHS is already recruiting more home-grown nurses, promoting return to practice programmes and improving retention of existing staff. For example, an additional £5 million will support the Return to Practice scheme, aimed at encouraging and supporting experienced nurses who have left the profession to return. More than 2,300 returners have been on the programme, with over 700 now back in employment. Reforms to the funding of pre-registration nurse education will enable universities to significantly expand training places by the end of the parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Government greatly values the important work that Agenda for Change (AfC) staff do in delivering essential public services and it is crucial that the public sector continues to recruit, retain and motivate the highest quality staff. In responding to the 2013 Francis Enquiry into the appalling events at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, it was right that trusts wanted to ensure they had the right number of nurses to provide safe quality care. The demand for nurses was much higher than planned, but nearly three years on,  trusts cannot either provide safe quality care or balance their books; they must do both.\r\n\r\nThere is a trade-off between pay and jobs in many public services, and pay restraint is one of the many difficult choices the Government has had to make.  At Summer Budget 2015, the Government announced that it will fund public sector workforces for an average pay award of 1 percent for four years from 2016/2017.  The Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that this policy will protect 200,000 public sector jobs. Whilst pay restraint is challenging, CPI inflation has been at historic low levels, currently 0.6%. Overall earnings for nurses and other non-medical staff have increased year-on-year since 2010/11, in total by 4.0% or 0.8% a year. Average basic pay per full time equivalent has increased by more than the impact of annual pay awards.\r\n\r\nAverage earnings for qualified nurses were £31,214 in the 12 months to June 2016, a slight increase from the same time last year and above the £31,189 figure for the NHS as a whole, which remains well above the national average salary for 2015 of £27,500 a year.\r\nFor nurses and midwives employed in the NHS between March 2010 and March 2015, average total earnings (adjusted for changes in contracted hours) increased by 2.2% a year.\r\n\r\nThe NHS is one of few public sector workforces that receive incremental pay. Around half of AfC staff receive incremental pay of around 3% on average.  A typical qualified nurse (Band 5) can expect seven years of pay progression averaging around 3.8% a year, in addition to annual pay awards.\r\n\r\nWe know pay is not the only reason nurses and other health workers choose a career in the NHS. The reward package also includes a valued pension scheme and other non-pay benefits. Members of the pension scheme can generally expect to receive around £3 to £6 in pension benefits value for every £1 they contribute, while flexible working patterns help staff better manage their personal commitments.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate that housing and travel costs in London can be a barrier to recruiting and retaining the nurses and other key workers the NHS needs.  The reward package for AfC staff that work in and around London includes High Cost Area Supplements:\r\n•\t20% of basic salary, subject to a minimum payment of £4,158 and a maximum payment of £6,405 for staff that work in ‘inner’ London;\r\n•\t15% of basic salary subject to a minimum payment of £3,518 and a maximum payment of £4,483 for ‘outer’ London; and\r\n•\t5% of basic salary, subject to a minimum payment of £961and a maximum payment of £1,665 for the London ‘fringe’.\r\n\r\nThe Department is also considering how best to take account of the housing requirements for NHS staff, particularly in high-cost areas to support permanent staffing.\r\n\r\nThe 2015 NHS Staff Survey shows that for nurses and midwives morale and motivation has improved since 2014. It is critical that the NHS continues to work hard on its staff engagement strategies. We want the NHS to be a place where nurses want to work, where poor care, poor behaviour, bullying and harassment is not tolerated. We know there is a strong link between the reduction in patient standardised mortality rates and organisations with high staff engagement.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2016-11-11T13:59:50.754Z","updated_at":"2016-11-11T13:59:50.754Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":165672,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/165672.json"},"attributes":{"action":"End the badger cull instead of expanding to new areas","background":"Since 2013, thousands of badgers have been killed in a Government cull attempting to control bovine TB.

","details":"Bovine TB is the greatest animal health threat to the UK. Dealing with this dreadful disease is costing taxpayers over £100 million each year and last year alone more than 28,000 cattle had to be slaughtered in England, causing devastation and distress for farmers and rural communities, where often herds have often been built up over many generations.   \r\n\r\nThat is why it is essential that we eradicate bovine TB.  \r\n\r\nWe are taking strong action to deliver a long-term plan to eradicate the disease and protect the future of the UK’s dairy and beef industries, with a comprehensive strategy including tighter cattle testing and movement controls, improving biosecurity on farm and when trading, and badger control in areas where badgers are an important factor in spreading disease to cattle.   \r\n\r\nThis approach is backed up by the evidence and experience of other countries. This approach has successfully eradicated bovine TB in Australia and is working in Ireland and New Zealand.  \r\n\r\nThere is still a long way to go. While cattle controls can have a significant impact, the Government’s Chief Veterinary Officer and the British Veterinary Association agree that we won’t eradicate the disease without dealing with the spread of TB from infected wildlife too.   \r\n\r\nThere is broad scientific consensus that badgers are implicated in the spread of TB in cattle in parts of England. \r\n\r\nTB was first found in English badgers in 1971. In 1974 badgers were removed from a severely infected cattle farm with the result that there were no herd TB outbreaks there for five years. Between 1975 and 1978 the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food funded work that demonstrated conclusively that there is a link between TB in badgers and cattle. Subsequent work in Ireland has reaffirmed that finding.\r\n\r\nThe Krebs Review observed that between 1975 and 1979 when gassing was used to remove badgers, cattle TB incidence in the South-West fell from 1.65% to 0.4%, a 75% reduction. Subsequently, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, more widespread badger removal was carried out in three areas. In Thornbury, Gloucestershire, cattle TB incidence fell from 5.6% in the ten years before badger removal to 0.45% in the fifteen years afterwards, a reduction of 90%. In Steeple Leaze, Dorset, there were no herd TB outbreaks for seven years after badgers were removed. In Hartland, Devon, cattle TB incidence dropped from 15% in 1984 to just 4% in 1985, a reduction of more than two thirds.\r\n\r\nFollowing concerns that those exercises lacked rigorous scientific ‘controls’ the government commissioned the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT). Despite the challenge of the Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak, the RBCT showed that in the four years after proactive badger removal there was a significant reduction in cattle TB incidence relative to control areas. The greatest relative reduction seen was 54% in the eighteen months after proactive badger removal operations, when the full benefits began to appear. The RBCT confirmed what the previous exercises had shown.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicensed badger control operations led by local farmers and landowners in parts of Gloucestershire, Somerset and Dorset have shown that it is safe, humane and effective in reducing the number of badgers needed to bring down disease levels in cattle.  \r\n\r\nBased on the advice of the Chief Veterinary Officer, we are extending this approach over a wider area to bring greater disease control benefits to hard-pressed farmers in the South West. \r\n\r\nWe have also funded licensed private badger vaccination projects to help create a buffer zone around the South-West where TB is most widespread. However TB vaccination does not provide complete protection and it has no impact on infected badgers so it cannot replace culling and a shortage of the vaccine means it’s not an option right now.  \r\n\r\nTo ensure we have a successful and resilient industry, we are determined to use all available measures necessary to eradicate this devastating disease as quickly as possible.   \r\n\r\nWe will continue to deliver on our 25-year strategy for a TB-free England. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","created_at":"2016-09-21T14:25:14.646Z","updated_at":"2016-09-21T14:25:14.646Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":170740,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/170740.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Suspend the Myanmar Ambassador for Genocide of Rohingya Muslims.","background":"\r\nYale's Allard K.

It is clear that the Muslim Rohingya minority are being persecuted and denied fundamental rights. The policy of the British Government is that any judgment on whether genocide has occurred is a matter for international judicial decision, rather than for governments or non-judicial bodies.\r\n\r\nWe are particularly concerned by the recent flare-up of violence. This was triggered on 9 October, when three Burmese Border Guard Police posts were attacked by Rohingya militants. We condemn this attack in which nine police and eight attackers were killed.  Since then, media, humanitarian and diplomatic access to North Rakhine has been limited by the imposition of a curfew while the military carry out security operations to root out the perpetrators and retrieve the weapons taken during the attacks.  \r\n\r\nAlthough the lack of access makes facts difficult to verify, we are deeply concerned about a growing body of anecdotal evidence suggesting human rights violations in the security response.  Reports suggest there could be a serious humanitarian impact if aid is not resumed quickly, particularly impacting those already affected by malnutrition.\r\n\r\nIn response to the latest outbreak of violence, our Ambassador visited northern Rakhine together with a number of international counterparts and the UN Resident Coordinator on 2-3 November. He has also lobbied five Ministers (most recently on 21 November), urging a restrained security response, an independent investigation and for the immediate resumption of humanitarian access. \r\n\t\t\r\nThese same messages were repeated by the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs with responsibility for human rights, Baroness Anelay, who visited Burma from 9-12 November. She called on Burmese Ministers to launch an investigation into allegations of human rights abuses, and called for an immediate resumption of humanitarian aid.\r\n\r\nThe UK also discussed the issue at the UN Security Council on 17 November, where we raised our concerns about the lack of humanitarian access.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Burma has now committed to investigating both the 9 October attacks and allegations of human rights abuses carried out during the military operations in the wake of the initial attack on 9 October. It has also given a further commitment to restore humanitarian access to northern Rakhine State. We believe our efforts are best focused on monitoring implementation of these commitments and pressing privately if they do not move forward.  We further believe the best approach to finding a long-term solution to the underlying inter-communal tensions in Rakhine State is to work with the democratically elected Government to de-escalate tensions. We do not believe expelling the Government’s representative in the UK would assist this process.\r\n\r\nSince coming into power in April, Burma’s Government has taken some encouraging steps to begin tackling the issue of Rakhine and the treatment of the Rohingya community. In August State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi announced the establishment of a new hybrid Burmese/international Rakhine Advisory Commission headed by Kofi Annan to provide advice and recommendations for a durable solution to the problems of Rakhine State. We take this announcement as a sign of the seriousness with which the NLD-led Government views the situation there.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we will continue to monitor the situation closely.  Our priority remains the resumption of humanitarian aid.  The UK has long been one of the biggest bilateral humanitarian donors to Burma and to Rakhine State. Since 2012, we have provided over £18m in humanitarian assistance, supporting work, including on sanitation and nutrition for over 126,000 people.\r\n\r\nForeign and Commonwealth Office","created_at":"2016-12-01T11:31:31.225Z","updated_at":"2016-12-01T11:31:31.225Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":160883,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/160883.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Close sharia courts set up in the uk and make sharia law illegal in britain","background":"There are thought to be around 100 Sharia Law courts operating throughout the UK, dispensing Islamic justice outside the remit of our own legal system.

They were the subject of extensive public consultation, and all the views put forward were considered before the standards were finalised.\r\n\r\nSince July 2015, NHS England has been working with hospital trusts and others to assure that patients benefit from a service that meets the agreed standards both now and into the future.

NICE will confirm whether it is proceeding with this in due course.\r\n\r\nIt is for NHS commissioners to decide whether to make continuous glucose monitoring devices available to their local populations, taking NICE’s guidance into account.\r\n\r\nAs one way of incentivising improvements to diabetes services, NHS England has introduced the Best Practice Tariff for paediatric diabetes which provides an annual payment for the treatment of every child and young person under the age of 19 with diabetes, providing 13 standards of care are met.\r\n\r\nOne of these standards is to ensure that each young person has received a structured education programme, tailored to their and their family’s needs, both at the time of initial diagnosis and ongoing updates throughout their attendance at the paediatric diabetes clinic. \r\n\r\nThe CCG Improvement and Assessment Framework measures progress being made by CCGs in improving outcomes. It includes measures on: \r\n•\tthe proportion of diabetes patients that have achieved all the NICE-recommended treatment targets. (The treatment targets include having HbA1c levels within recommended limits. HbA1c is a measure of patients’ blood glucose levels) and:  \r\n•\tthe proportion of people with diabetes diagnosed less than a year who attend a structured education course. \r\n\r\nTaken together, these should help identify both whether patients are being supported to understand how to manage their blood glucose levels and whether the approaches being taken in a CCG area are successfully achieving improvements in this.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2016-10-07T09:46:31.353Z","updated_at":"2016-10-07T09:46:31.353Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":170006,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/170006.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Set up Independent Pump-Watch body to monitor and regulate vehicle fuel pricing","background":"You may be surprised to learn that how much we pay to fill up our cars vans and trucks isn’t regulated at all.

A competitive market is the best way to keep prices low; a new regulator is not necessary.","details":"The Government believes that it is essential that consumers get a fair deal and that falls in oil prices are passed on to lower retail prices without unnecessary delay.  This can most effectively be achieved through an open and competitive market, which drives prices down.  We will therefore continue to make it clear to industry that we expect it to pass any savings that result from lower oil prices onto customers.  \r\n\r\nThe Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy monitors and publishes weekly national average pump prices: \r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/oil-and-petroleum-products-weekly-statistics\r\n\r\nAnalysis by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy suggests that on average, at a national level, crude price changes are fully passed through into pump prices within 6-7 weeks. This time represents wholesale contractual arrangements and the time taken for fuel to be delivered to filling stations through the supply chain. There is no evidence to suggest that, for given changes in crude oil prices, retail prices rise faster than they fall.\r\n\r\nMovements in pump prices are primarily driven by crude oil prices; though are also influenced by a range of other factors; including refining capacity, stock levels, biofuels cost, distribution costs and retail margins. Tax and duty is the largest single component of retail petrol and diesel prices; as fuel duty is charged at a fixed rate per litre, retail product prices are therefore always less volatile than crude prices. A reduction in crude oil prices will consequently produce a less than proportionate reduction in retail product prices. Another factor affecting the relationship between crude prices and the retail price of oil products is the exchange rate. Crude oil and oil products are traded in dollars, and so when the value of pound sterling decreases against the dollar, oil becomes more expensive for UK consumers.\r\n\r\nThe Office of Fair Trading’s call for information on the petrol and diesel sector, published in 2013, found that competition in the road fuels sector was working relatively effectively, although it was found that fuel is often significantly more expensive at motorway service stations. Action has since been taken at Autumn Statement 2014 to trial new road signs that display motorway service station petrol and diesel prices for motorway drivers. The aim of the trial is to determine whether the new fuel comparison price signs are effective in providing useful information to road users and to understand the impact of improving fuel price transparency on driver behaviour and fuel prices at Motorway Service Areas. \r\n\r\nCommercially managed Apps or Websites are also available for motorists that provide price comparisons between petrol stations to help them to save money.  \r\n\r\nFrom this analysis we do not think that establishing a new regulator with the associated costs of establishing such a body would be justified.  The sector is subject to the normal competition and consumer protection law.  \r\n\r\nOn 1st April 2014 the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) became the UK's lead competition and consumer body. The CMA brought together the existing competition and certain consumer protection functions of the Office of Fair Trading and the responsibilities of the Competition Commission. The CMA will work to promote competition for the benefit of consumers, both within and outside the UK. Its aim is to make markets work well for consumers, businesses and the economy. If people have evidence of anti-competitive practices in the fuel supply sector they should pass this to the CMA.  \r\n\r\nThe Government recognises fuel costs remain a significant part of both business and household costs. This is why at Budget 2016 the Government announced that fuel duty will be frozen for the sixth successive year.  The Government has frozen fuel duty in every year from 2011 to lessen the impact of high fuel prices on households and business costs.  By the end of 2016-17, fuel duty will have been frozen for seventh successive years resulting in the longest fuel duty freeze for 40 years. \r\n\r\nIn addition, people living across seventeen of the UK’s most rural communities benefit from a 5 pence per litre relief on fuel duty. The scheme allows 125,000 people living in the selected areas, who currently face some of the highest fuel prices in the country despite depending on cars for transport, to benefit from cheaper fuel. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy","created_at":"2016-12-08T10:07:18.244Z","updated_at":"2016-12-08T10:07:18.244Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":164851,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/164851.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Protect grouse Moors and grouse shooting","background":"Grouse moors and grouse shooting are an integral part of moorland management both for the grouse and other native wildlife such as lapwing and curlew it also helps support of local businesses and jobs in the local areas this cannot be banned ","additional_details":"Here is a link to the Countryside Alliance website for more information on how grouse moors benefit the environment and the facts behind it:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.countryside-alliance.org/ca-flatcap/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Grouse-Shooting-The-Facts-10-Key-Questions-Answered-July-2016.pdf","state":"open","signature_count":25044,"created_at":"2016-08-14T12:21:58.222Z","updated_at":"2016-12-31T19:18:34.475Z","open_at":"2016-08-15T13:01:14.433Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":"2016-10-10T15:42:37.725Z","scheduled_debate_date":"2016-10-31","debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":"2016-11-01T09:59:16.458Z","moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2016-08-14T14:14:57.817Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2016-08-23T09:36:35.184Z","creator_name":"Jack Bryant ","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"Grouse shooting is a legitimate activity that provides economic benefits, jobs and investment in some of our most remote areas and can offer important benefits for wildlife and habitat conservation.","details":"A report by the UK shooting community (Public \u0026 Corporate Economic Consultants report 2014: The Value of Shooting) concludes that the overall environmental and economic impact of game bird shooting is positive; the industry has estimated that £250 million per year is spent on management activities substantially benefiting conservation. For grouse shooting in particular, according to the Moorland Association, estates in England and Wales spent £52.5 million on managing 149 grouse moors for shooting in 2010.

The industry also supports 1,520 full time equivalent jobs and is worth £97.7 million across Great Britain. \r\n\r\nGrouse shooting takes place in upland areas, which are important for delivering a range of valuable “ecosystem services”, including food and fibre, water regulation, carbon storage, biodiversity and recreational opportunities for health and wellbeing.

","details":"Protecting the public from harm remains a priority for this Government, and we have been clear that those offenders who continue to pose a risk will remain subject to notification for life.  The public should rest assured that sex offenders will not automatically come off the register; the order only provides a mechanism by which a sex offender can apply for a review.   \r\n\r\nOn 30 July 2012 the Sexual Offences Act 2003 was amended by the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (Remedial) Order 2012 to introduce a mechanism which will enable registered sex offenders who are subject to notification requirements for life to apply for those requirements to be reviewed.  \r\n\r\nThis was as a result of an earlier Supreme Court ruling that our then law on indefinite sex offender registration without the right for review was incompatible with article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). \r\n\r\nThe Government fully acknowledged the ruling of the Supreme Court and took appropriate action as is its duty; to uphold the independence of the judiciary by complying with the judgement.\r\n\r\nUnder the previous Government, we made changes to the notification requirements introducing additional measures which sought to strengthen the existing mechanism by making it mandatory for all registered sex offenders to notify to the police:\r\n\r\n•\tall foreign travel;\r\n•\tweekly, where they are registered as having ‘no fixed abode’;\r\n•\twhere they are living in a household with a child under the age of 18; and;\r\n•\ttheir bank account and credit card details, and information about their passports or other identity documents.\r\n\r\nWe continue to work with the police and other law enforcement agencies to ensure that the right powers are available for the authorities to tackle sexual crimes and to bring perpetrators to justice. \r\n\r\n\r\nPolicing of child abuse images\r\n\r\nThe Government agrees that industry has a responsibility to work together with law enforcement and Government to prevent and inhibit the use of their services by those seeking to generate and share child abuse material. In 2015, Google announced that it had made changes to its search algorithm to prevent images and videos containing child abuse material from appearing in search results.  They have publicly stated there has been an eight-fold reduction in child sexual abuse image related search queries since. \r\n\r\nThe Internet Watch Foundation, which is funded by industry, has been active in facilitating the removal of indecent imagery of children from the internet. Their efforts have helped the UK see a reduction from the UK hosting 18% of web pages of child abuse imagery, to 0.2% by 2015.  Since April 2014 as permitted by Government, they have proactively sought out child sexual abuse material to take action to get this material removed.  \r\n\r\nAt the WePROTECT summit in December 2014, industry committed to taking digital hashes of known child abuse imagery in order to ensure these could be identified and referred to the US National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, and removed.  As of October 2016, over 34,750 image hashes have been shared among industry by the IWF. \r\n\r\nSentencing\r\n\r\nSentencing is entirely a matter for our independent courts.   When deciding what sentence to impose the courts take into account the circumstances of the offence and any mitigating and aggravating factors, in line with the sentencing guidelines.  Maximum penalties are kept under review to ensure that the courts have adequate powers to deal with offences effectively and proportionately.\r\n\r\nThe independent Sentencing Council are responsible for issuing guidelines to the courts.  In December 2013 the Sentencing Council issued a revised guideline on sentencing for sexual offences, which came into force in England and Wales in April 2014.  \r\n\r\nUnder the Protection of Children Act 1978 (as amended), the UK prohibits the taking, making circulation and possession with a view to distribution of any indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph of a child under 16.  Such offences carry a maximum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment.  Section 160 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 also makes the simple possession of indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs of children an offence.  This carries a maximum sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment.  This age was raised to 18 in the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and there are defences for those aged over the age of consent (16) who produce sexual photographs for their own use within a marriage or civil partnership.  These defences are lost, however, if such images are distributed. \r\n\r\nThe Sexual Offences 2003 Act significantly modernised and strengthened the laws on sexual offences in England and Wales to provide extra protection to children from sexual abuse and sexual exploitation.  It was designed to meet 21st century challenges of protecting children, and addresses issues including internet pornography and ‘grooming’ children for sexual abuse.  \r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2016-11-09T13:23:12.643Z","updated_at":"2016-11-09T13:23:12.643Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":168107,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/168107.json"},"attributes":{"action":"UK Govt to strongly condemn Pakistan for providing safe haven for terrorists","background":"Pakistan continues to double speak on issue of terrorism.

The pace of biomedical science is putting more pressure on budgets across the developed world all the time as new and increasingly targeted drugs are developed.  These are often expensive and all health systems face difficult decisions about how to prioritise inevitably finite resources.  \r\n\r\nTuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is a rare genetic condition that can lead to non-cancerous tumours  developing in different parts of the body.  Although everolimus (Votubia) is licensed for the treatment of some TSC-related conditions including renal angiomyolipoma (AML) and subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), it has not been appraised by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for these conditions.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of NICE guidance, it is for commissioners to make funding decisions based on the available evidence.\r\n\r\nNHS England has operational responsibility for specialised commissioning.  It has been managing the clinical prioritisation process for specialised commissioning which considered the cost/benefit of everolimus for SEGA relative to a number of other treatments being considered for prioritisation this year. \r\n\r\nIn July 2016, NHS England set out the results of its annual process for deciding which new treatments and services it will make available to patients. These decisions were however provisional and subject to the outcome of a judicial review relating to NHS England’s commissioning power in relation to a different unrelated treatment.\r\n\r\nOn 2 August 2016, following the judgment being delivered on the outstanding judicial review, NHS England announced that it would, subject to the outcome of an appeal, be re-running its prioritisation process to include those policies that were previously prioritised in levels 3, 4 and 5.  Full details of NHS England’s announcement are available at: www.england.nhs.uk/2016/08/august-update-on-the-commissioning-and-provision-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-prep-for-hiv-prevention/. \r\n\r\nBefore the prioritisation process is re-run there will be a further opportunity for pharmaceutical companies, including Novartis (the manufacturer of everolimus), to offer better prices which would increase the likelihood of treatments being given a higher priority.  However if everolimus to treat SEGA remains at its current priority level of 5 then it will be considered again next year in the prioritisation process for 2017/18, taking into account any new evidence that may have emerged in that time.  The re-run of the prioritisation process is expected to take place at the end of October with final decisions being made in November 2016.  NHS England recognises the need to streamline decision-making and is considering how it can improve the balance between proper consideration of a new treatment, and pace.\r\n\r\nAlthough everolimus for SEGA is not being routinely funded by the NHS, the Individual Funding Request (IFR) route remains open to clinicians for patients with exceptional need. This enables clinicians, on behalf of their patients, to make an application for funding to NHS England for treatments that it does not routinely commission.  Demonstration of clinical exceptionality is a threshold criterion that needs to be met before funding can be considered.  That is, an IFR can only be considered if the patient can be demonstrated to be clinically exceptional compared to the wider group of patients and is likely to derive greater benefit from the treatment.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2016-09-13T16:15:03.848Z","updated_at":"2016-09-13T16:15:03.848Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":175561,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/175561.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Work with UK Sport to reinstate GB badminton funding for the next Olympic cycle","background":"UK Sport have announced it is giving ZERO funding to GB badminton’s Olympic programme, despite exceeding the medal target by winning bronze in Rio.\r\nThis is an incomprehensible decision.

Woodcock, snipe and golden plover are amongst those species that may be taken. In England and Wales the dates for woodcock are 1 October to 31 January; common snipe 12 August to 31 January; golden plover 1 September to 31 January.\r\n \r\nShooting is a legitimate activity and in addition to providing jobs and investment in some of our most remote areas, it can offer important benefits for wildlife and habitat conservation. The Government’s manifesto commits to protect shooting for the benefits it brings to individuals, the environment and the rural economy.\r\n\r\nRecent data shows that the woodcock has a breeding population or around 78,000 pairs; common snipe 76,000 and golden plover between 38,000 and 59,000. Overwintering populations increase their numbers to approximately 1.4 million (woodcock), 1 million (common snipe) and 400,000 (golden plover). The numbers in winter are greatly increased as a result of birds arriving from Scandinavia, the Baltic States and Russia and many of our breeding birds (and their offspring) leave the country in winter.  \r\n\r\nFor all three species, the numbers of birds hunted is small compared with the population present in the country during the open season.\r\n\r\nWhen combined with the fact that many of our breeding birds winter abroad, it is unlikely that hunting pressure in this country has played a significant role in the recent downwards trends in the size and range of GB breeding populations of either woodcock or snipe. There is little evidence that the golden plover is currently in decline in GB as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for any declines are complex and include habitat loss as a result of land drainage, the drying out of natural woodlands, declining woodland management, the maturation of new plantations, overgrazing by deer, recreational disturbance and reductions in prey availability. The woodcock is currently red-listed due to breeding range decline in the past 25 years.\r\n\r\nMeasures have been taken to improve habitats through Environmental Land Management schemes such as the Countryside Stewardship Scheme, where grassland breeding waders have been specifically targeted. The woodcock will have benefited from Woodland Grant Schemes, some of which specifically target management for declining woodland birds.\r\n\r\nThe Government is not persuaded that the current level of hunting has a significant detrimental impact on the numbers of woodcock, common snipe and golden plover.

Nevertheless, demand for the Crossing is increasing. \r\nHE is working with partners to reduce the impact of incidents on journey times and ensure that the Crossing, the motorway approaches, and the connections with local routes on both sides of the Crossing work as well as they can. The government has no plans to launch a public inquiry into the performance of the northbound Crossing. However, we are closely monitoring conditions at the Crossing and will use the data we are collecting to understand how various factors are contributing to its performance. \r\n\r\nThrough its plans for a new Lower Thames Crossing the Government has a clear long term approach to increase capacity in the area and improve journeys. A consultation on a new Lower Thames Crossing took place earlier this year and a decision on the preferred route is due shortly. In the short term HE is working with partners to do all that is possible to improve traffic flow on the northbound approaches to the Dartford Crossing. \r\n\r\n‘Free-flow’ charging, known as Dart Charge, was introduced at the Crossing in November 2014.  The collection and payment of the road user charge is carried out remotely so drivers no longer stop and pay within a barrier-controlled environment. Introducing ‘free-flow’ charging at Dartford has delivered improvement whilst the government develops further options for additional crossing capacity on the Lower Thames. \r\n\r\nDart Charge has reduced journey times for drivers. These have been delivered despite an increase in traffic volumes of 7.2% over the last year (almost an extra 3.7 million crossings). Drivers are also seeing other benefits. Over one million drivers have Dart Charge accounts and are saving up to a third on every crossing, and more people living in Dartford and Thurrock are benefitting from the Local Residents Discount scheme than ever before.\r\n\r\nEven with ‘free-flow’ charging the Government is aware that there is still a wider congestion problem. With around 55 million vehicle crossings a year the Crossing is currently operating at over 117% capacity and traffic is expected to continue to grow.  In the immediate term, HE is closely monitoring the performance of the Crossing and the motorway approaches, and is looking for measures to improve journey times and reduce incidents.\r\n\r\nTo reduce congestion at the Crossing, HE is looking at the tunnel operating systems, at how traffic uses the northbound approaches and at the response to incidents to see what can be done to improve them.  \r\n\r\nDrivers may experience some delays on the northbound approaches to the tunnels due to the operation of the tunnel safety system of traffic lights, which was introduced to prevent queuing traffic within the tunnels, and to control the passage of oversized vehicles and those carrying dangerous goods. Around 300 vehicles approach the tunnels in the wrong lane each month and the impact of just one oversized vehicle entering the wrong tunnel could be extremely severe.\r\n\r\nThe new system was put into operation in summer 2015.

Please tell us what you think through the consultation.","details":"We are consulting on further reform of the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). On 31 October we launched a Green Paper consultation on how we can further improve the process, such as through separating decisions on financial support from decisions on employment support. We are also consulting on how we can simplify and streamline assessments - particularly for those with the most severe health conditions and disabilities. Over the coming months we will be consulting with disabled people and those who have health conditions, as well as with carers, families, professionals, and a range of organisations who, like us, want to see further change. \r\n\r\nWhile reforming the welfare system so that the greatest number of people possible have the opportunity to lead a full and fulfilling life in work, we are protecting those who, through disability or ill health, are unable to work. We are conscious that it is of vital importance that while supporting so many people in such a range of circumstances, we treat every individual with the dignity and humanity they deserve.\r\n\r\nThere are circumstances in which we carry out internal reviews to establish whether anything related to an individual’s benefit claim should have been done differently. These could include cases where a complaint has been made by somebody who has been identified as vulnerable, or where we receive information that an individual has attempted or completed suicide and it is alleged that Departmental activity may have contributed to this – in these latter circumstances a review is mandatory.\r\n\r\nIt is a mechanism to get a factual account of events related to the individual’s claim, without opinion or judgement attached. The fact that a review has been carried out does not of itself imply that the Department was at fault.\r\n\r\nIn order to protect individual claimants as much as possible, a number of safeguards have been built into Employment and Support Allowance (ESA); some since its inception and others subsequently - some as a result of recommendations made in the independent reviews of the WCA.\r\n\r\nFor instance, Visiting Officers can visit individuals in their own homes if concerns have been raised about their vulnerability. As well as helping to complete benefit claims they can explain any requirements placed on claimants at various stages of their claim, and the consequences of not doing so without good reason. They can also relay concerns back to the Department if they are particularly concerned about an individual’s welfare. This could result in the person taking a decision contacting the claimant’s GP, social services department or, for example, their community mental health nurse if they have one.\r\n\r\nIn cases where it is likely a claimant will be found fit for work, the claimant is contacted by telephone to review the information already held, and to request any additional information that they could consider before making their decision. If they do then decide to find the claimant fit for work, they explain to the claimant that their ESA award will stop, and advise them which benefits they could apply for. The Department will make two separate attempts to contact the claimant; in cases where the claimant is vulnerable and cannot be contacted they will arrange a safeguarding home visit to the claimant. \r\n\r\nIf claimants are unhappy with the decision on their benefit claim they can ask for a mandatory reconsideration, where all of the evidence is looked at again by a different Decision Maker. As part of this process the claimant will be asked if there is any other evidence or information that they would like to be considered. If, following a mandatory reconsideration, the claimant is still not satisfied with the decision they have the right to lodge an appeal at the First-tier Tribunal.\r\n\r\nThe fairness of the welfare system remains one of its most important characteristics, and we are keen to make further improvements wherever possible. That’s why the Secretary of State announced on 1 October that we are stopping ESA reassessments for those with the most severe and life-long conditions, as well as announcing on 16 November that we want to ensure the sanctions system works for people with mental health problems and that from next year jobseekers who are homeless or who have a mental health condition will be able to immediately access hardship payments if they receive a benefit sanction. This change is expected to help around 10,000 people over four years from 2017/18.  \r\n\r\nWe welcome all views as part of our consultation: https://consultations.dh.gov.uk/workandhealth/consult\r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions","created_at":"2016-11-28T16:08:22.111Z","updated_at":"2016-11-28T16:08:22.111Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":136595,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/136595.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Maintain the Erasmus scheme despite Britain's exit from the European Union","background":"My degree programme consists of a placement year which is part-funded by the Erasmus scheme.\r\n\r\nHowever, the EU referendum has endangered access to this funding for myself and thousands of others.

As we conduct our negotiations, it must be a priority to regain more control of the numbers of people who come here from Europe - but also to allow British companies to trade with the single market in goods and services. We are about to begin these negotiations and it would be wrong to set out further specific positions in advance. At every step of these negotiations we will work to ensure the best possible outcome for the British people. Ministers are listening to the concerns raised by the academic community, students and parents. While we remain in the EU we retain all our rights and obligations as a Member State, including the right to participate in Erasmus. \r\n\r\nFor students, international mobility can help enhance their communication skills, confidence and employability. International and cross cultural experience and communication skills are valued by employers. HE institutions also benefit from increasing the mobility of their student population.  As well as improving the employability of their graduates, mobility periods enhance the overall student experience the institution is able to offer prospective students, making them more competitive in terms of the students they can attract.  Furthermore, increasing student exchanges with institutions abroad can contribute to the institution’s overall internationalisation strategy – leading to greater research collaboration between academics, for example, and improving the global reputation of the institution.  Because we value these benefits the Government is supporting a sector led UK strategy for Outward Mobility, which aims to increase the number of UK students who access international placements as part of their degree programmes. (http://www.go.international.ac.uk/go-abroad.) To support such mobility students on the EU Erasmus scheme for a full year abroad have their tuition fees capped at 15% of the permitted level for their institution in the year they spend abroad, and are entitled to an additional tuition fee loan to cover this. Their institutions receive a HEFCE grant of £2,250 per student for that year in addition to the 15% fee from the student. These 'fee waiver' arrangements also apply to those going abroad to study, but not work, under other mobility schemes.  \r\n\r\nErasmus (European Action Scheme for the Mobility of University Students) began in 1986 and its popularity is such that it has given its name to the entire EU education, training youth and sport programme, 'Erasmus+', which runs from 2014-20, and which provides funding for the specific Erasmus HE mobility scheme. It enables university students at all levels to undertake study or work placements in another EU country, or certain others (the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Turkey) as part of their course.  The minimum placement period under the scheme is three months, or two for work placements, and the maximum one year. It is currently the largest single such student mobility scheme for UK students; in 2013/14 there were 15,566 Erasmus placements in Europe. The vast majority of outgoing Erasmus students are undergraduates, and a little less than half are studying languages. In 2012/13 27,147 European students undertook a placement in the UK. It is up to individual institutions to decide how many students they send and receive.\r\n\r\nThe scheme is administered in the UK by the Erasmus+ National Agency, which receives funding from the EU Erasmus+ programme to fund outgoing students (the Government pays the Agency a management fee to cover the administrative costs). Students receive a non-means tested grant of between €250 and €400 per month whilst abroad, depending on which country they visit. Premiums of €100 per month are paid to all on work placements and to those on study placements qualifying as disadvantaged students.  Additional help from EU funding is available for those with special needs.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education","created_at":"2016-09-19T10:43:42.751Z","updated_at":"2016-09-19T10:43:42.751Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":167761,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/167761.json"},"attributes":{"action":"All West Sussex Schools to receive pupil funding at the national average.","background":"Currently West Sussex Schools receive one of the lowest levels of pupil funding in the country.

This year, the core schools budget will be over £40 billion – the highest on record. \r\n\r\nWe are aware that under the current funding system education spending is not distributed fairly and consistently. That is why we are committed to introducing fairer funding for schools so that funding is transparently matched to schools’ and children’s needs. In doing so, we will fund the education system in a way that promotes social mobility and social justice.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year we conducted the first stage of consultation on our proposals for making the funding system fairer by introducing the National Funding Formulae (NFF) for schools and high needs. We initially proposed to introduce the NFF from 2017-18.\r\n \r\nIn July the Secretary of State announced that the NFF will be introduced in 2018-19 instead, to allow time for full and proper consultation on these important proposals. It also allowed us to give certainty to local authorities about their budgets in 2017-18.\r\n\r\nWe recognise West Sussex is a relatively low-funded local authority. In 2015-16 we took a step towards fairer funding by allocating an additional £390 million to low funded authorities through the “minimum funding levels” reform. West Sussex received an additional £930,000 from this reform. The extra funding for West Sussex was included in their baseline in 2016-17, and is protected in their baseline for 2017-18.\r\n \r\nWe also recognise that many schools are facing cost pressures and that they have worked to find efficiencies. A national funding formula will give headteachers more certainty about their funding over the longer term so that they can better manage their budgets. We are also providing support to help schools improve their financial health, including a range of information, guidance and tools available at: \r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/collections/schools-financial-health-and-efficiency.\r\nIn the next stage of consultation, we will set out our plans for how the formula will be implemented including the impact on schools and local authorities.

As part of our response to the 2014 ‘Workload Challenge’, the Department for Education established three independent review groups to address the three biggest causes of unnecessary workload identified by teachers - marking, planning and resources and data management. These groups published their reports in March 2016.\r\n\r\nThe reports include clear messages which empower classroom teachers and school leaders to challenge unproductive tasks. They make recommendations to the whole teaching profession, and encourage schools to reassess and streamline their practice and review it on an ongoing basis. We have accepted, and are acting on, the recommendations for Government. As the reports make clear, it is for everybody involved in education to act on the principles and recommendations in these reports.\r\n\r\nTeaching continues to be an attractive profession for high quality graduates, with 18 per cent of this year’s cohort again holding a first class degree whilst 74 per cent of trainees hold a 2:1 or above.

Options that are suitable for vegans should be made available where individuals request this however any revisions in menu options provided need to reflect the needs of the population served.\r\n\r\nEvery hospital has a responsibility to provide the highest level of care possible for their patients and this, without question, includes the quality and nutritional value of the food that is served and eaten. The NHS Constitution includes the right; ‘You have the right to receive suitable and nutritious food and hydration to sustain good health and wellbeing’, and the constitution handbook sets the expectation that dietary requirements should be reasonably met, whether specific or unusual to an organisation’s general population, for example cultural or religious. This includes the provision of vegan foods.\r\n\r\nIt is a fundamental requirement that prisoners and members of staff are provided with meals which meet an individual’s religious, cultural and medical dietary needs. Consequently, the menu choices and meal provision reflect the religious and cultural needs of the prison.\r\n\r\nThe government’s School Food Standards regulate the food and drink provided at both lunchtime and at other times of the school day.  Beyond this, we believe that head teachers, school governors and caterers are best placed to make decisions about their school food policies, taking into account local circumstances and the needs of their pupils. In doing so, we expect schools to make reasonable adjustments for pupils with particular requirements, for example to reflect dietary and cultural needs. \r\n\r\nLike schools, we would expect further education colleges and providers and higher education institutions, as autonomous organisations which are responsible for making their own decisions on the catering arrangements they have in place for students, to want to make reasonable adjustments for their students with particular requirements, for example to reflect dietary and cultural needs. \r\n\r\nThe issue of diet is complex with many factors including cultural, social and religious influencing the make-up of what we eat. The Government does not aim to undermine these influences, and we see value in encouraging people to think carefully about the environmental impact of the food they eat.

The condition is characterised by a slow progression and patients are managed on a case by case basis as symptoms develop. In a small proportion of cases a stem cell transplant is the most appropriate form of treatment. \r\n\r\nNHS England published the criteria used for routine clinical commissioning of stem cell transplants in 2013 which is available at: www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/b04-p-a.pdf. This commissioning policy for stem transplants reflects the professional consensus on the benefit and risk of a transplant for different conditions that was available when the policy was formulated. In the UK this guidance came from the British Society for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation (BSBMT) in the form of best-practice guides for treatment of adults (2012) and children (2011). This guidance is regularly updated to take account of developments in clinical practice. WM was only added to the guidance in September 2013 and therefore NHS England did not include this condition as part of the overall clinical commissioning policy. This means that NHS England does not routinely commission stem cell treatments for WM patients and that funding of stem cell transplants for these patients has involved other funding mechanisms. Over the last few years some patients have received a stem cell transplant to treat WM. In these cases funding may have involved an Individual Funding Request (IFRs) or been directly funded from an NHS trust.\r\n\r\nEach year, NHS England receives proposals for new drugs, medical devices or interventions for use by specialised services in England. NHS England has to make difficult operational decisions on behalf of tax-payers about how to prioritise the funding that is available for new investments. NHS England needs to ensure it focuses resources on those interventions which deliver the best results for patients, taking into account the evidence for clinical benefit and cost. \r\n\r\nProposals are reviewed by the Clinical Priorities Advisory Group (CPAG) that follows a published procedure. A proposal to routinely commission transplant for patients with WM will be considered by CPAG later this year and NHS Trusts will be informed of the outcome. Until that time, clinicians can continue to apply for funding for stem cell transplant for patient with WM where it can be demonstrated that a transplant is the most appropriate treatment option.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2016-10-12T09:08:43.969Z","updated_at":"2016-10-12T09:08:43.969Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":166442,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/166442.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Please sign the petition for the Robin to become our official National Bird.","background":"This petition is being co-ordinated by David Lindo - also known as The Urban Birder - a natural history broadcaster and writer.

She acknowledged that it had been a difficult decision to make.\r\n\r\nIn determining whether or not to establish a statutory inquiry or other review, the Home Secretary considered a number of factors, reviewed a range of documents, carefully scrutinized the arguments contained in the Campaign’s submission and spoke to members of the Campaign. She concluded that neither an inquiry nor a review was required to allay public concern, more than 30 years after the events in question. In doing so, she noted the following factors:\r\n\r\n•\tDespite the forceful accounts and arguments provided by the campaigners and former miners who were present that day, about the effect that these events have had on them, ultimately there were no deaths or wrongful convictions.\r\n\r\n•\tIn addition, there have been very significant changes to policing since 1984, at every level, including major reforms to criminal procedure, changes to public order policing and practice, stronger external scrutiny and greater local accountability.\r\n\r\nIn particular the operational delivery and practice of public order policing has moved on a great deal from the arrangements in 1984, and tactics have now been reviewed and altered several times both by the police and the courts.\r\n\r\n•\tProtections which were singularly lacking at the time of Orgreave now exist with the introduction of the Police \u0026 Criminal Evidence Act 1984 which has vastly improved the way police investigations and powers operate.\r\n\r\n•\tThe creation of the Crown Prosecution Service in 1986, with the introduction of independent CPS prosecutors, fundamentally altered the prosecution of offences. It ended the existence of ad hoc prosecution arrangements across the country whereby a mixture of police prosecutors and private firms of solicitors - hired by the police and acting for and on the instruction of the police – conducted prosecutions.\r\n•\tWith regards to the external scrutiny of complaints against the police, this was strengthened by the creation, in 1985, of the Police Complaints Authority which was replaced in 2004 by the more effective Independent Police Complaints Commission and in turn will be replaced by the Office for Police Conduct in 2017. The exemplary standards of behaviour expected of everyone who works in policing were reinforced by the introduction of a statutory Code of Ethics, laid before this House in 2014.\r\n\r\n•\tLastly, the introduction of directly elected Police and Crime Commissioners in 2012 has given the public a voice in shaping their local policing priorities and improved the accountability of police leadership.\r\n\r\nAs a result there would therefore be very few lessons for the policing system today to be learned from any review of the events and practices of three decades ago. This is a very important consideration when looking at the necessity for an inquiry or independent review and the public interest to be derived from holding one. Taking these considerations into account, the Home Secretary does not believe that establishing any kind of inquiry is required in the wider public interest concern or for any other reason.\r\n\r\nThe Home Secretary believes that the focus should now be on continuing to ensure that the policing system is the best it can be for the future, including through reforms currently before Parliament in the Policing and Crime Bill, so that the public can have the best possible policing both in South Yorkshire and across the country.\r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2016-11-21T13:54:57.628Z","updated_at":"2016-11-21T13:54:57.628Z"},"debate":null}}]}
