Personalised support is available and targeted at those that need it most.","details":"The best way to help people out of poverty is to help them into work. Work is the pillar of a strong economy and a strong society and we believe that work should always pay, that we should have a welfare system that helps people into work, supports people who need help, and is fair to those who pay for it. \r\n\r\nThe old system which UC is replacing is complicated, inflexible and involves different agencies and Government departments. This complexity would often mean that people were put off from taking up offers of employment or taking on more hours.\r\n\r\nUniversal Credit is revolutionising the welfare system by making work pay. It simplifies the system and provides a single payment for people in or out of work which ensures that people are always better off working and better off working more. There are none of the cliff edges or complicated hours rules of the old system, just a single, simple, taper so payments reduce in a transparent and predictable way as earnings increase.\r\n\r\nUniversal Credit provides unprecedented level of personalised support. People receive tailored support managed through personal work coaches, who know each person’s case and have more tools than ever before to help people prepare for work and get a job. \r\n\r\nWe know this is having a positive impact on employment outcomes, it’s been proven by three separate research studies. Compared to the old system, people on Universal Credit are more likely to be in work after 6 months, spend more time looking for a job, more time looking to increase their earnings and will actually consider work they wouldn’t have considered doing before.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Government recognises that high childcare costs can affect parents’ decisions to take up paid work or increase their working hours. We increased the level of support for childcare costs within Universal Credit from 70 per cent to 85 per cent. The intention is that families will get more out of the money that they earn, and will find that it pays to get a job, from taking the first step back into work, right up to working full-time.\r\n\r\nWe want to make sure that Universal Credit is fair to claimants and to the taxpayer that funds it, and that support is targeted at those that need it most. Each jobseeker receiving UC takes on a ‘commitment’ or ‘contract' which is the obligation to look for and take on work, and in return receive the benefit payment as planned. This clearly sets out what is expected of jobseekers, the support they get to move into work and the consequences of not adhering to the requirements, which can include sanctions. All requirements that are set are reasonable and achievable for each individual claimant, taking their circumstances into account. \r\n\r\nWe want to ensure that 18 to 21-year-olds do not slip straight into a life on benefits, which is why we are helping young people get the training, skills and experience they need to move into a job and build a career. The change to housing costs support for this group will ensure young people in the benefit system face the same choices as young people who work but may not be able to afford to leave home. We know that personal circumstances will differ so we have worked closely with stakeholders to develop a fair and robust set of exemptions to protect the most vulnerable young people.\r\n\r\nUniversal Credit aims to support all people to participate fully in society, including remaining in or returning to work. Many disabled people want to work but feel the risk of losing their benefits is too great. Part of the design of Universal Credit is to simplify the current provision in legacy benefits so that Universal Credit is simpler to understand and deliver, and less prone to fraud and error. Rather than replicate every aspect of disability provision in the current legacy system, we have removed the complexity of dealing with different rules for seven different disability additions. There will also be transitional protection for those claimants with existing premiums whose circumstances do not change who move over to Universal Credit as part of the managed migration process, if their overall entitlement would be less than under the old system.\r\n\r\nThe Government recognises the importance of self-employment and small businesses to the economy and to society. As part of the Government’s wider growth strategy, we are keen to help self-employed people to achieve their potential and progress in work. We are also keen to support new enterprise and there is a range of support for small businesses such as the new Enterprise Allowance. Universal Credit supports people into self-employment where it is the best route for them to become financially self-sufficient. The aim is to increase the number of people progressing from low earning self-employment and becoming more self-sufficient in the long term and to encourage those reporting very low self-employed income to increase their earnings. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions","created_at":"2017-11-15T10:33:53.482Z","updated_at":"2017-11-15T11:30:18.722Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":205348,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/205348.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Pass legislation making animals legally \"Sentient Beings\" in UK law.","background":"Following the failure of the House of Commons to support the transfer of the EU Protocol on animal sentience in Article 13 of Title II of Lisbon Treaty into UK law, we demand primary legislation making animals legally \"sentient beings\" in UK law.","additional_details":"","state":"open","signature_count":16589,"created_at":"2017-11-16T12:04:42.452Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T17:14:08.268Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-11-23T10:27:23.998Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-11-16T13:36:14.578Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2017-11-26T12:20:31.450Z","government_response_at":"2017-12-18T15:11:46.387Z","debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Robert Webber","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"The government is committed to the very highest standards of animal welfare as we leave the EU.

As the Secretary of State set out in his Written Ministerial Statement on 12 December, there was never any question that this government’s policies on animal welfare are driven by the fact that animals are sentient beings. We have published a draft Bill which underlines the government’s commitment to raising animal welfare standards. The draft Animal Welfare (Sentencing and Recognition of Sentience) Bill increases the maximum prison sentence for animal cruelty tenfold to 5 years in prison and clearly recognises animal sentience in domestic law. The Bill also requires UK government Ministers to have regard to the welfare needs of animals when formulating and implementing government policy. We are currently seeking views on the draft Bill.  Anyone who wishes to comment has until 31 January 2018 to do so.  \r\n\r\nArticle 13 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) has not delivered the progress we want to see. It only applies to the implementation and formulation of EU-level policy and has had minimal impact even in those areas. Our draft Bill is a significant improvement, both recognising animal sentience and imposing a clear duty on the state to have regard for animal welfare. Ultimately, Article 13 has failed to prevent practices across the EU which are cruel and painful to animals. \r\n\r\nIn contrast, here in the UK, we are already improving animal welfare standards without EU input and beyond the scope of Article 13. We are making CCTV mandatory in all slaughterhouses – a requirement which goes above and beyond any EU rule. We propose combatting elephant poaching with a ban on the ivory trade which is more comprehensive than anywhere else in Europe. Our ban on microbeads which harm marine animals has been welcomed by Greenpeace as “the strongest in the world”, and is certainly the strongest in Europe. \r\n\r\nThis Government will continue to promote and enhance animal welfare, both now and after we have left the EU.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment.

The Government therefore continues to support shooting, recognising it is vital that wildlife and habitats are respected and protected and we ensure a sustainable, mutually beneficial relationship between shooting and conservation.\r\n\r\nThe Government recognises the international importance of the UK uplands. The UK has 75 percent of the world’s remaining heather moorland and about 13 percent of the world’s blanket bog (rain-fed peat bog that ‘blankets’ the landscape). Seventy percent of the UK’s drinking water is provided from upland catchments and tourism brings in an estimated £1.78 billion to England’s upland national parks.\r\n\r\nWith regard to grouse moorland management, grouse shooting is one of the main land uses in the uplands along with grazing and forestry. The Government recognises that healthy, active peat provides good habitat for grouse as well as numerous environmental benefits and ecosystem services. Natural England is working with landowners of grouse moors within Special Areas of Conservation to develop voluntary agreements, which include vegetation management principles for the various habitats on grouse moors. The Government encourages land managers to work closely with Natural England to put voluntary agreements in place for all the benefits they bring to moor owners and to the environment. \r\n\r\nThe Government is also working with moor owners and stakeholders to further improve management practices and peat condition, such as through the Blanket Bog Restoration Strategy.\r\n\r\nWith regard to birds of prey, like all wild birds they are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.

There are many legitimate, commercial reasons for people to do this and for businesses to engage them in this way. The off-payroll working rules, more commonly known as IR35, have been in place since 2000 to ensure that, where individuals would have been employees if they were providing their services directly, they pay broadly the same tax and National Insurance as other employees. It is fair that two individuals doing the same job in the same way pay broadly the same tax and National Insurance, even if one of them structures their work through a company.\r\n\r\nAs highlighted by reports from the Office of Tax Simplification and the House of Lords, it is clear that IR35 is not effective enough. To improve compliance, the Government introduced reforms in the public sector from April 2017. Individuals working through their own company in the public sector are no longer responsible for operating the off-payroll rules. Instead, where an individual’s company is directly engaged by a public sector body, the public sector body is responsible for determining whether or not the rules apply, and deducting any necessary employment taxes on payments to the individual’s company. Where this engagement takes place through an agency, the public sector body is responsible for determining whether or not the rules apply and informing the agency of this decision, in order that any necessary employment taxes can be deducted by the agency.\r\n\r\nThis is not a new tax on the self-employed. IR35 only applies to those who work like employees and would have been employed were they not working through a company. Genuinely self-employed individuals continue to be unaffected, as has been the case for over 15 years.\r\n\r\nThe Government is monitoring the impact of its reform of IR35 in the public sector.

","details":"The Government fully recognises the enormous sacrifices that have been made by British military personnel. Remembrance ceremonies and parades are an important and valued means by which communities across the country honour the sacrifice of British service personnel.\r\n\r\nWe are very sensitive to the pressures the police face. We recognised the importance of wider policing in the 2015 Spending Review, which protected overall police spending in real terms. Also nationally, the police hold over £1.6 billion of financial reserves.\r\n\r\nForces are expected to hold reasonable contingencies in their budgets to cover the costs of policing events, particularly annual ceremonial events such as Remembrance Sunday parades. Additional funding is normally only considered in respect of special events where their policing costs exceed one per cent of a police force’s total funding, or where meeting these costs would place a force at financial risk.\r\n\r\nThere is no Government policy on road closures for Remembrance Sunday Parades and there is no proposal to introduce legislation. It is for the local traffic authority (that is, the council of the relevant county or metropolitan district, not the police) to decide on the road closure or other legally enforceable traffic management measures it considers necessary for the conduct of any local on-road event. These are decisions for which it is responsible to its electorate. \r\n\r\nRoad closures for local Remembrance Sunday Parades are effected through Traffic Regulation Orders made under section 16A of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. Section 16A is used to close roads temporarily for \"sporting events, social events or entertainment\", collectively known as special events. Under section 16A, a local traffic authority can impose temporary highway restrictions for a special event once and for up to three days in any calendar year. \r\n\r\nRestrictions for special events over and above this that affect the same length of road require the consent of the Secretary of State for Transport. Otherwise, the Department for Transport does not get involved and the event remains purely a local matter. Where the Secretary of State’s consent is required, the Department does not impose conditions on the way that the road is to be closed and does not charge the local authority for granting consent. \r\n\r\nAs with any event, decisions on the deployment of resources to police road closures are operational matters for the Chief Constable of the force concerned, in association with Police and Crime Commissioners. The Police have not and do not routinely police Remembrance Parades and are more likely to determine the level of policing required for an event on the basis of an assessment of crime, disorder and public safety. \r\n\r\nThe police’s role is to enforce the general law on road traffic and any special measures introduced for the event in question, such as a local Traffic Regulation Order. They also have a general power to direct traffic. The authority or police may advise the local community on other steps that might be taken and associated measures that might be desirable, such as the taking out of insurance. How the police carry out enforcement is a matter for their discretion.\r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2017-11-08T09:57:36.327Z","updated_at":"2018-01-09T17:19:09.506Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":209872,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/209872.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make Hedgehogs a Protected Species","background":"We, the undersigned, call on the government to make hedgehogs an officially protected species and to limit activities which may disturb, degrade or destroy their habitats.

Tragic cases such as Brandon’s death highlight the need to do all we can to prevent it and tackle every instance where it arises. \r\n \r\nThat is why we have sent a clear message to schools that bullying, for whatever reason, is unacceptable and should not be tolerated.  \r\n \r\nMost bullying can be dealt with within schools’ existing disciplinary frameworks. We are making Relationships Education in primary schools, and Relationship and Sex Education (RSE) in secondary schools mandatory, and we expect the associated guidance to cover issues such as respect, friendships, cyber-bullying and staying safe online. We have recently launched a call for evidence to gather the views of teachers, parents, and young people to help us shape relationships education and RSE. \r\n \r\nLaws are already in place to protect people when any form of bullying behaviour constitutes a criminal offence. This includes some types of harassing or threatening behaviour, or communications which can be a criminal offence, for example under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, the Malicious Communications Act 1988, the Communications Act 2003, and the Public Order Act 1986.  \r\n \r\nIf school staff, or parents, feel that a criminal offence may have been committed they should seek assistance from the police. This would be the case regardless of whether or not a young person was attending school. Therefore, we do not believe there are gaps in existing laws or processes regarding how bullying behaviour which constitutes a criminal offence should be handled.  \r\n \r\nIt is for the police to decide whether to investigate or prosecute. Police forces are operationally independent of Government and it is their chief officers who determine the resources allocated to particular priorities. This is in line with the Policing and Crime Plans, published by Police and Crime Commissioners, to whom chief officers are accountable. Guidance on the way that suspected offences are investigated is produced by the College of Policing, the professional body for policing. \r\n \r\nFor this reason, the Government has no current plans to introduce any additional legislation in relation to criminalising bullying behaviour.  \r\n\r\nDepartment for Education","created_at":"2018-01-03T13:33:26.809Z","updated_at":"2018-02-08T10:17:04.076Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":203202,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/203202.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make offering gay conversion therapy a criminal offence","background":"Being gay is not an illness, yet to this day gay people are still offered 'therapies' to cure themselves.

It is a vital way to protect children (and others) against a range of serious diseases and we strongly encourage families to take up vaccinations when offered. \r\n\r\nAll our vaccination programmes are based on expert review of the evidence from the Joint Committee on Vaccination \u0026 Immunisation (JCVI) – it bases its recommendations on a comprehensive review of a wide range of scientific and other evidence, including from the published literature, and commissioned studies such as independent analyses of vaccine effectiveness and cost effectiveness. https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/joint-committee-on-vaccination-and-immunisation\r\n\r\nMen B is a terrible disease and the Department would like to extend its deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Layla Rose Ermenekli. However, the UK MenB vaccination programme is based on the advice of the JCVI.  The JCVI recommended that MenB immunisation should be routinely offered to the group of children at the highest risk, and reviewed all available evidence in determining their advice.\r\n\r\nTheir advice is summarised in the following statement:\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/meningococcal-b-vaccine-jcvi-position-statement\r\n\r\nFollowing JCVI’s recommendation, the UK is proud to have been the first country to introduce a national, publically funded MenB immunisation programme for infants using the Bexsero® vaccine. Since September 2015, all infants aged two months have been offered the MenB vaccine, followed by a second dose at four months and a booster at 12 months. Since May 2017, all children under two have become eligible for vaccination. The vaccine is also available to a small number of older children and adults who are at an increased risk of infection, such as those with specific underlying medical conditions. \r\n\r\nThe JCVI keeps the eligibility criteria of all vaccination programmes under review and considers new evidence as it emerges. The JCVI has considered older age groups (1-4 year olds) but did not advise a catch up programme. The JCVI have also requested further research to reduce uncertainty and give a greater level of confidence on whether a vaccination programme for adolescents would be cost effective. Specifically, the JCVI have requested a study of the effect of MenB vaccination on the carriage of meningococcal strains in adolescents. An open competition process has been carried out, and completed, to commission this work, which the selected research team could potentially begin by the end of 2017.\r\n\r\nMenB is, thankfully, very rare and incidence has been declining since 2000/2001. There were about 1,600 cases of MenB in 2000/01 compared to 444 MenB cases in 2015/16 and the vaccine protects against the majority of MenB strains for infants and those who are at risk of meningococcal disease. \r\n\r\nThere are, however, strains of group B meningococcal bacteria which are not covered by the vaccine and cases can still occur in vaccinated infants and children. It is therefore very important for parents to be alert to the symptoms of meningococcal disease such as fever, blotchy skin, refusal to feed, irritability, cold hands and feet, rash, muscle pain, and a stiff body with jerky movements or else floppy and lifeless. Parents should trust their instincts and seek urgent medical attention if they have concerns. Further information is available publically on the NHS choices website; https://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Meningitis/Pages/Introduction.aspx \r\n\r\nPublic Health England (PHE) has been collaborating with charities about how best to help parents understand the signs and symptoms of meningitis and septicaemia.

In areas identified as especially high risk, such as the hard shoulder on motorways, the Department for Transport placed a specific responsibility on Highways England, under the Infrastructure Act 2015, to have due regard to the need to protect and improve the safety of the strategic road network as a whole for all road users. This includes ensuring that roadside vehicle recovery operations are safe for both recovery drivers and all other road users. \r\n\r\nAs a first step towards this goal, the Government set a challenging target. Highways England has a target to reduce those killed or seriously injured on their strategic road network, of a decrease of at least 40% by the end of 2020 against the 2005-09 average baselines. Further details on Highways England’s Health \u0026 Safety 5 year plan is available on the Highways England website: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/highways-england-health-and-safety.\r\n\r\nRules 219 and 281 of the Highway Code provide for emergency and incident support vehicles and their corresponding warning signs or flashing lights. These rules advise drivers to be aware of emergency or incident support vehicles on the road: it provides advice on which warning lights or signals these vehicles use, and advises drivers to exercise extra care and attention including slowing down, being prepared to stop, and to follow any directions given by police officers, or traffic officers, as to whether drivers can safely pass an incident or blockage.\r\n\r\nWhether on the strategic road network or on local roads, the police already have powers to deal with road users who do not slow down or move over for vehicles that have broken down or been involved in accidents on the roadside. Road users, are required to comply with road traffic law in the interests of their own safety and that of other road users. If road users do not adopt a responsible attitude, or if their use of the highway creates an unsafe environment or causes a nuisance, they may be committing a number of offences. For example, under sections 2 and 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (as amended) a person may be charged with the offences of dangerous driving, or careless and inconsiderate driving. In each case it is for the police to enforce the law.\r\n\r\nThe Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 also requires employers to ensure the safety of their employees during the course of their work. HSE would expect that employers have arrangements in place to ensure that safe working procedures are used, vehicles and equipment of an appropriate standard are provided and maintained, where necessary, appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) is provided and used, and all persons have been adequately trained by a competent person on how to work safely at the roadside and the precautions they should be recommending to the occupants of incident support vehicles. For further details please visit the Health and Safety Executive website: http://www.hse.gov.uk/foi/internalops/sims/manuf/3_04_61.htm.\r\n\r\nAdvice on safe systems of work for ensuring the health and safety of both roadside technicians and members of the public who may be affected by their activities, has been published in the British Standard Code of Practice, BS 7121-12:1999 “Safe use of cranes - Part 12: Recovery vehicles and equipment - Code of Practice”; and the British Standards Institute (BSI) publication PAS43 “Safe working of vehicle breakdown and recovery operators: Management system specification”. This guidance on the safe management of vehicle breakdown and recovery operations was produced by SURVIVE.

Aside from the Health and Care Professions Council, the fee required by the NMC is the cheapest of the nine. \r\n\r\nThe NMC’s fee has been held at £120 per annum since February 2015. This has been made possible due to operational efficiency savings made by the NMC, which have offset cost pressures, including inflation.   \r\n\r\nThe NMC has informed us that its Council undertakes an annual review of registration fees, to ensure it has sufficient funds to carry out its regulatory functions to the level required to protect the public.\r\n\r\nSince its establishment in 2002, the NMC has increased its annual fee on three occasions: in August 2007 from £43 to £76, in February 2013 from £76 to £100 and in February 2015 from £100 to £120. In each case the proposed increase was subject to public consultation and scrutiny. These increases were deemed essential to ensure the NMC was adequately funded to exercise its statutory duties in order to protect the public.\r\n\r\nSince June 2016, nurses and midwives have been able to spread the cost of their annual registration fee through quarterly direct debit instalments. This flexible payment mechanism was introduced by the NMC in response to feedback received from its registrants. \r\n\r\nIn addition, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) permits individuals to claim tax relief on professional subscriptions or fees which have to be paid in order to carry out a job. Therefore, nurses and midwives are eligible to claim tax relief on the annual registration fee they pay to the NMC. At present, a basic rate UK taxpayer would be eligible for £24 tax relief on the annual registration fee of £120 and claims can be made for the last five years. \r\n\r\nThe NMC has informed us that guidance on how to apply to HMRC for tax relief is available on its website (www.nmc.org.uk) and that it regularly raises awareness of this option with registrants.

They are an important indicator of the great strides we have made in improving our waterways, with more than 5,300 miles of rivers being improved since 2010. There have been no reintroductions of otters by conservation groups since the late 1990s and the bulk of the recovery of the otter has been through natural re-colonisation.  \r\n\r\nA healthy otter population results from favourable conditions in the natural environment, including water quality and the availability of prey (including fish), as well as availability of breeding sites. Otters are found at low density, and limit their own populations through territorial activity. Carrying capacity is determined by environmental conditions.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence to suggest that otters have a major impact on wildlife as a whole, and although localised impacts could occur where otters have not been previously present for some time, they are a natural part of the freshwater ecosystem and we believe these systems will adapt to the return of the natural top predator.  \r\n\r\nWe do recognise that otters can in some instances impact on still water fisheries, which is why there is provision through the Angling Improvement Fund (AIF), administered by the Angling Trust on the Environment Agency’s behalf, to help deliver improvements including projects to protect fisheries from otter predation through the erection of otter-proof fencing.

These rules help to ensure safety on our roads.  They support the police and other enforcement agencies in identifying vehicles to prevent and detect crime particularly through the use of Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to displaying the registration number, the law provides for the voluntary use of the display of the European Union flag (the circle of stars) or specific national identifiers.  The display of the European flag with the inclusion of a GB identifier, called the Europlate, enables motorists to travel within the European Union without the need to display the conventional oval ‘GB’ sticker to identify the member state in which the vehicle is registered.  Currently, UK motorists travelling within the EU can display either the traditional oval GB sticker or the Europlate.  No decisions have yet been taken on the status of the Europlate after the UK leaves the EU. \r\n\r\nThe law was changed in 2009 to also allow the voluntary display of UK national flags.  This means that motorists are able to choose to display the Union Flag, the Cross of St George, Scottish Saltire or the Red Dragon of Wales on their number plate.   However, it is entirely a matter of personal choice whether to display a national flag on a number plate and no one is compelled to do so.  There are no plans to make the display of the Union flag on vehicle number plates compulsory. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport\r\n","created_at":"2018-01-09T13:54:51.269Z","updated_at":"2018-01-09T13:54:51.269Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":202061,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/202061.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Introduce an Act of Parliament supporting ADHD adults and children (ADHD Act)","background":"The charity ADHD Action calls upon the UK Government to pass an Act of Parliament that will broadly: \r\n1) Place a duty on the Government to produce a broad strategy for ADHD adults and children which is kept under regular review.\r\n2) A duty to produce statutory guidance to ensure implementation.","additional_details":"There are currently many challenges to the UK ADHD community, which affects approximately 5% of children and 2.5% of adults.\r\nChanges in areas below will ensure significant cost savings to public services, and improve quality of countless lives:\r\nEducation\r\nHealth (including mental, sexual and addiction support)\r\nCriminal justice (police, prisons, probation)\r\nWork, pensions and benefits\r\nEmployment law \r\nLocal authorities (e.g. social services, homelessness)\r\nMedia (responsible reporting)\r\n\r\nadhdaction.org","state":"open","signature_count":11487,"created_at":"2017-10-03T11:25:11.503Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T23:21:44.297Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-10-06T16:47:31.351Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-10-03T11:45:00.333Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2017-11-17T11:27:01.819Z","government_response_at":"2017-12-04T16:21:37.915Z","debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Michelle Beckett","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"The NHS Act 2006, the Care Act 2014, and the Children and Families Act 2014 provide a robust statutory framework for supporting people with ADHD, backed by investment in mental health services. ","details":"The Government is committed to supporting children, young people and adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and improving their quality of life. We recognise the importance for people with ADHD of receiving a timely diagnosis and appropriate support. Current legislation and guidelines set out how services should support people of all ages with ADHD. \r\n\r\nIn 2016, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published a guideline on diagnosing and managing ADHD for people aged 3 and above. This aims to improve the diagnosis of ADHD as well as the quality of care and support for people with an ADHD diagnosis. An updated guideline is expected to be published in February 2018.\r\n\r\nThe Care Act 2014 represents the most comprehensive reform of social care legislation in over 60 years. The Act puts in place requirements for local authorities to meet a person’s eligible care and support needs, including those of people with ADHD, and to help and protect people with care and support needs, who may be at risk of abuse or neglect as a result of those needs. \r\n\r\nThe Government recognises that children and young people with ADHD often need special educational provision and under the Children and Families Act (2014), local authorities, health and care services must commission services jointly to ensure the needs of children and young people with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) are met. Local Authorities must publish a clear outline of services available which has been developed for, and with, parents and young people. \r\n\r\nWe have also introduced a more streamlined assessment process to develop Education, Health and Care plans to support children and young people with SEND. These are co-ordinated across education, health and care, and involve children and young people and their families throughout the process.\r\n\r\nThese measures aim to reduce health inequalities and improve outcomes for children and young people with SEND and their families.  \r\n\r\nWe recognise that having ADHD can lead people to experience mental health problems and the Government is committed to improving mental health support and services. We have increased funding for mental health services by 8.4% since 2014/15 and last year, spend was the highest ever at £11.6bn.  \r\n\r\nWe have also commissioned NICE and the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health (NCCMH) to improve mental health service pathways and tackle variations in provision. NHS England’s ‘Standard for Mental Health Investment’ ensures that NHS investment in mental health increases year on year. \r\n\r\nThe Government has introduced the Children and Young People’s Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme (CYP IAPT) which aims to improve Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). 90% of the 0-18 population are covered by this change programme and we are on course to reach 100% by 2018. \r\n\r\nWhilst we recognise the need to continue to improve support for people with ADHD, we believe the existing statutory framework provides the scope to achieve this and have no current plans to introduce a specific Act of Parliament. \r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2017-12-04T16:21:37.912Z","updated_at":"2017-12-04T16:21:37.912Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":201785,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/201785.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Pay carers an allowance equivalent to a fulltime job at the National Living Wage","background":"Paying unpaid carers would safeguard those requiring care making it a financially viable option for friends and family to look after those they love, Reducing pressure on 999 services and the NHS.

By 2022/23 annual spend will be £4bn.","details":"The Government recognises the invaluable contribution that unpaid and family carers make in all our communities, and is committed to doing more to support them. The support we need to provide extends far beyond financial support however. The Department of Health plans to publish a Carers Action Plan this spring setting out plans around support for carers.\r\n\r\nFormal carers, i.e. those who are employed as “professional” carers, do of course need to receive all the protections that employment law offers, including receiving at least the National Living Wage/National Minimum Wage from their employers. \r\n\r\nInformal carers are those who provide care for family or friends and they do receive help through the benefit system, primarily through Carer’s Allowance (CA) (which was introduced in 1976) and for those on lower incomes, through means-tested benefits. For people who give up the opportunity of full-time employment in order to provide regular and substantial care for a severely disabled person, CA aims to provide a measure of financial support and recognition, but it is not designed to be a carer’s wage or to replace all lost earnings. \r\n\r\nA carer may apply for CA if they provide care for 35 hours or more a week to a person on one of the qualifying disability benefits. They must be aged 16 years or over and not be in full time education (21 hours or more a week). For those carers who can undertake some part-time work, there is an earnings limit in Carer’s Allowance. CA can be received alongside part-time earnings of up to £116 net of certain expenses a week (rising to £120 net a week from April 2018). Allowable expenses include income tax, National Insurance contributions and half of any contributions to an occupational or personal pension. Also, up to half the net earnings figure calculated can be allowed towards the cost of alternative care for the disabled person, or for a child aged under 16, while the carer is at work. These rules mean that people can earn significantly more than the earnings limit and still get CA. Where possible, informal carers are encouraged to continue either working or studying part-time alongside their caring responsibilities in order to improve their own life chances and increase their social interaction. \r\n\r\nCA is funded from general taxation and does not depend on an individual's National Insurance contributions. CA is up-rated in line with the Consumer Price Index and since 2010 the rate has increased from £53.90 to £62.70 (rising again to £64.60 a week in April). That means that from April 2018, carers will be £550 a year better off than they were in 2010. By 2022/23 we will be spending nearly £4 billion a year on CA. This is a clear indication of the Government’s commitment to carers.\r\n\r\nCarers who are on low incomes can also claim income-related benefits, such as Income Support and Pension Credit. These benefits can be paid to carers at a higher rate than those without caring responsibilities through the carer premium or the equivalent additional amount for carers respectively, both currently worth up to £34.95 a week (increasing to £36.00 a week in April). Receipt of means tested benefits can act as a “passport” to help with prescriptions and dental charges. \r\n\r\nPeople who are not eligible for Carer’s Allowance but who are looking after sick or elderly family or friends may be eligible for Carers Credit which helps them build qualifying years for State Pension. To qualify for carer’s credit a person must be caring for one, (or more), person for at least 20 hours a week, be over 16 years old but under State Pension age. The person being cared for must get one of the following: \r\n•       A qualifying benefit, or \r\n•       Be certified by a health or social care professional as needing the amount of care being provided \r\n\r\nThe Government’s Fuller Working Lives Strategy sets out what the Government is doing to support those carers who wish to remain in and return to work; as well as highlighting the sort of support that good employers should give to carers in their workforce, such as flexible working. To spearhead some of this work the Government appointed the Business in the Community (BiTC) Age at Work leadership team as Business Champion for Older Workers. The Leadership Team spearhead the Government’s work to support employers to retain, retrain and recruit older workers. They actively promote the benefits of both employing and retaining older workers to employers across England – influencing them both strategically and in terms of practical advice. This work also benefits carers in the workplace. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions","created_at":"2018-02-28T17:06:48.916Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T17:06:48.916Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":204653,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/204653.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Parliament must debate whether the PM should disclose any offshore interests.","background":"It is a matter of public interest whether the PM or her husband have offshore interests.

As the Prime Minister said when she attended the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) in 2016 “intelligence we have received in the past from Saudi Arabia has saved potentially hundreds of lives in the UK.”\r\n\r\nEngagement with Saudi Arabia provides an opportunity to further develop our relationship, building the trust and respect necessary to enhance our engagement on all areas of mutual concern. Visits in both directions are an important opportunity for us to have constructive discussions about the full range of issues that are of mutual concern. \r\n\r\nThe Crown Prince has embarked on a series of reforms to modernise society and the economy within Saudi Arabia. The country is changing rapidly, with steps such as allowing women to drive and attend football matches, reopening cinemas and a commitment that women will make up one third of the Saudi workforce by 2030. The Crown Prince has also set out his commitment to return Saudi Arabia to a moderate Islam that is open to all religions.\r\n\r\nThis greater inclusivity is vital for the future of Saudi Arabia and the UK will support Saudi Arabia as it embarks on this era of change. The Crown Prince’s agenda will bring new opportunities for us to work together for the long-term benefit, stability and success of both our countries. \r\nWe welcome the recent positive developments, but we also recognise that there are further steps to take. \r\nOur starting point for engagement on human rights with all countries is based on what is practical, realistic and achievable, and we will always be ready to speak out as a matter of principle. We raise our concerns with the Saudi Arabian authorities using a range of Ministerial and diplomatic channels of communication, including our Ambassador, the Embassy team and the European Union in Riyadh. So whilst there are areas where we will continue to have different views to Saudi Arabia – including human rights - our relationship enables us to speak frankly, openly and constructively about these issues.\r\n\r\nOn Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, along with other GCC member states, provided support to the Government of Bahrain in 2011 as part of the Peninsula Shield agreement. At the request of the Government of Bahrain, GCC security personnel were deployed to Bahrain to ensure vital infrastructure was secure. The UK monitors events in Bahrain closely and where we have concerns we raise these at senior levels. \r\n\r\nThe UK is committed to securing a political solution that ends the humanitarian disaster in Yemen, and supports the UN Special Envoy to Yemen in facilitating a credible peace process. The UK will continue to play a leading role in supporting the UN to find a peaceful solution to the conflict, including through close engagement with our regional and international partners. Inward visits provide further opportunities for the UK to discuss solutions to the crisis. \r\n\r\nThe UK supports the Saudi-led Coalition military intervention, which came at the request of the internationally-recognised Yemeni President Hadi, to deter aggression by the Houthis, and allow for the return of the legitimate Yemeni Government.  The Houthis have consistently failed to adhere to UN Security Council Resolutions, including by launching attacks against Saudi Arabia and shipping in the Bab al-Mandab strait.\r\n\r\nWe regularly raise the importance of compliance with International Humanitarian Law (IHL) with the Saudi Arabian Government and other members of the military Coalition.

We are ensuring that tenants will only be required to pay rent alongside a refundable deposit.\r\n\r\nMany letting agents and landlords acknowledge that fees charged to tenants are currently not at a level that is justifiable and agree that intervention is necessary. The Government does not believe that a cap would be effective and is likely to lead to a race to the top in terms of fees charged. A ban is easier to understand and enforce.\r\n\r\nWe believe that tenants will see a net saving as a result of the ban.  Tenants will be able to see what a given property will cost them in the advertised rent level without any additional hidden costs. This will help to make entering and moving around in the private rented sector easier and less costly.\r\n\r\nWe recognise that agents will need to consider their business models. The time of, and services provided by, letting agents should be reimbursed but this should be by landlords rather than tenants. Landlords are better able to shop around for the agent offering the service that they are seeking at the price they want to pay. It is also worth noting that landlords, unlike tenants, can claim tax relief on letting agent fees.\r\n\r\nGood letting agents, providing services that represent value for money to landlords, will continue to play an important role in the market. Furthermore, such letting agents will be on a fairer footing to compete for landlords’ business since it will be much harder for rogue agents to exploit their position between landlords and tenants. \r\n \r\nPublishing a bill in draft enables scrutiny of our proposals to ban letting fees by Parliament and stakeholders ahead of introducing legislation. The Communities and Local Government Select Committee is currently holding a public inquiry into the draft Bill. We welcome Parliamentary scrutiny on whether the draft Bill achieves its aim of delivering a fairer, more competitive, and more affordable lettings market where tenants have greater clarity and control over what they will pay and where the landlord is the primary customer of the letting agent. The Government will then seek to introduce the Bill formally to Parliament at the earliest opportunity. We will do this as soon as parliamentary time allows. We do not expect implementation to be before April 2019. This will allow letting agents time to prepare and re-negotiate their contracts.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Housing, Communities and Local Government","created_at":"2018-02-20T12:01:09.205Z","updated_at":"2018-02-20T13:48:40.475Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":200005,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200005.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Give all British citizens living abroad the right to vote and dedicated MPs","background":"About 1 million British citizens living abroad do not have the right to vote due to their overseas residency exceeding 15 years.
