The same as murder. I've read cases where the abuser has had lots of women locked up and raped all day long , even children. When he is found guilty he might only get 2 years in jail while these innocent people are destroyed. If this evil becomes a guaranteed life sentence it will decrease the numbers of victims. Any other punishment for such evil is too low.
