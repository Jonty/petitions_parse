It’s unfair to not have received the original letter on time and as a result the fine being multiplied and even in some cases warrants issued to bailiffs. I personally didn't receive the first PCN letter and the fine was £65, now the fine is £195 as a result of not receiving the 2nd class letter sent out by the local council. Is this fair or just a money making loop hole by the councils.","state":"open","signature_count":8,"created_at":"2018-06-27T08:37:46.742Z","updated_at":"2018-07-22T11:35:34.083Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-07-04T17:02:12.782Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-06-28T06:39:57.684Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Gary Rea","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":222913,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/222913.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make the history of British colonialism part of high school curriculum.","background":"Too many people, especially the new generation do not know anything about the British empire or the colonies which helped make Britain great.
