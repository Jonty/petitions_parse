","details":"The Government is committed to providing secure, affordable and clean energy, now and for the future. We need to replace our ageing infrastructure with low-carbon, reliable energy sources; and aim to do so through a mix of technologies and energy supplies, diversifying supply and reducing reliance on any one energy source. Keeping the lights on is non-negotiable.\r\n\r\nThe Government is clear that nuclear will be an important part of the future generation mix; a transition to a low carbon economy is key to our long term economic and environmental prosperity and, looking at the full costs to consumers, nuclear is both cost-competitive and low carbon. It is the only proven, large scale, low-carbon technology which provides base load supply. Currently, the UK has eight power stations which generate around 20% of electricity in the UK. Almost all of these existing power stations are due to close by 2030, and it is important we start to take action now to replace these.\r\n\r\nFollowing a review of the Hinkley Point C project, the Government has decided to proceed with the first new nuclear power station for a generation, subject to a number of conditions being accepted. Hinkley Point C will kick start a new era of nuclear power - building on Britain’s strong nuclear legacy – and help ensure the UK benefits from a diverse future energy mix designed to give consumers reliable and affordable low carbon energy. It will provide 7% of Britain’s electricity needs for 60 years. UK-based businesses will benefit from more than 60% of the £18 billion value of the project, and 26,000 jobs and apprenticeships will be created.\r\n\r\nThe Government is already committed to the renewable energy sector where it has a proven track record - nearly £52 billion has been invested since 2010. The average annual investment has more than doubled in the last 5 years, with an average of £9 billion invested each year in UK-based renewables. Annual support for renewable technologies will more than double, to over £10 billion, in 2020-21.\r\n\r\nSince 2010, the UK has more than trebled its renewable electricity capacity. Renewables’ share of generation increased by 6 percentage points on 2014 to a record 25% in 2015. For the first time, renewable sources provided more power over the year than coal. We are on track to comfortably exceed our ambition of delivering 30% of the UK’s electricity from renewables in 2020-21.\r\n  \r\nIn addition:\r\n•\tsolar PV has had rapid deployment over the past 5 years, with over 99% of the UKs capacity deployed since 2010 and almost 40% of the capacity (3.7GW) was installed in 2015\r\n•\tbio energy generation was 30% higher in 2015 compared to 2014\r\n•\toverall, wind generation was 26% higher than in 2014 and installed capacity 7.0% higher\r\n\r\nRenewables, such as wind farms, are intermittent and this is why the Government supports a balanced energy policy comprising a mix of sources, such as gas, nuclear and renewables.  With increased use of renewable energy, intermittency will become more of an issue and it is something we are planning for very carefully. We are seeking to keep energy bills down by not over incentivising technologies under low carbon incentive schemes. Furthermore, we are encouraging industry to drive down development costs, which is why the Contracts for Difference (CfD) strike price reduces over time.\r\n\r\nAs costs continue to fall, we will scale back support from sectors and redirect support to technologies where it is needed most. Onshore wind and solar costs have already fallen and so we have reduced support in those areas.\r\n\r\nThe Government is committed to providing investors with certainty and reducing risks for future investors. We are doing this whilst seeking to control costs that fall on consumers and ensuring that the Government’s other energy policy objectives, particularly on security of supply and climate change, are met.\r\n\r\nThe Government is clear that the transition to a low carbon economy is key to our long term economic and environmental prosperity; nuclear is part of that generation mix. Looking at the full costs to consumers, nuclear is cost-competitive and low carbon. Importantly it can provide continuous power, irrespective of whether the wind is blowing or the sun shining.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Energy \u0026 Industrial Strategy","created_at":"2016-09-28T14:29:09.283Z","updated_at":"2016-09-28T14:29:09.283Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":172778,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/172778.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Free Commando Sergeant Alexander Blackman from jail","background":"A soldier should never go to prison for killing the enemy in a battlefield situation.

There are no plans to introduce a rate specifically for HGV drivers. ","details":"The objective of the National Minimum Wage is to ensure that low income workers are fairly paid. The National Minimum Wage clearly demonstrates the Government’s commitment to protecting those on the lowest incomes, and to making work pay. \r\n\r\nThe National Living Wage was introduced in April 2016 and it specifies the minimum hourly rate that workers aged 25 and over should be paid. The rate is currently set at £7.20 and from April 2017 it will be increased to £7.50. The Government’s objective is for the National Living Wage to equal 60 per cent of median earnings in the UK by 2020. Around 3 million low income workers are expected to benefit directly from the National Living Wage by 2020, and up to 6 million in total could see their pay rise as a result of a knock-on effect of the policy.\r\n \r\nIt is important that Government strikes a balance between setting National Minimum Wage rates which support workers, and on the other hand avoiding rates which are too high and which could lead to an increase in unemployment. The Government achieves this balance by considering the expert advice from the Low Pay Commission (LPC), which is independent of Government and involves representatives from both employer and worker groups. \r\n\r\nThe LPC makes recommendations to the Government on what the National Minimum Wage rates should be, such that there will be no impact on employment levels. The LPC does this by gathering extensive evidence from across the economy including workers, their representatives and employers. The LPC’s recommendation for the National Living Wage rate is calculated slightly differently in that the LPC is asked to recommend the rate such that it reaches 60% of median earnings by 2020. \r\n\r\nPay rates over and above the appropriate National Minimum Wage or Living Wage rate are a matter between employers and workers. It is the responsibility of employers to ensure that their reward packages are competitive, in order to retain and develop the workforces which are fundamental to their success.\r\n\r\nMany employers pay their workers more than the legal minimum, where it is affordable for them to do so. So long as they are paying at least the legal minimum, this is a decision for employers to take. Therefore, the Government has no plans to introduce a higher minimum wage rate specifically for HGV drivers. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy","created_at":"2017-01-04T11:25:53.173Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T11:25:53.173Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":173099,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/173099.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Keep the Personal Injury Small Claims Limit at £1,000/ Keep Damages for whiplash","background":"The MOJ has published a consultation paper proposing amongst other things:-\r\n1.

All licensed drivers, vehicles and PHV operators have met their local licensing standards.","details":"Local authorities (and Transport for London in London) are the licensing authorities for taxis and PHVs. They have discretion to set standards that they deem to be appropriate for their area.\r\n\r\nThe standards for taxi and PHV licensing are set at a local level, this is usually the responsibility of the local authority. In London these standards are set by Transport for London. These licensing authorities have discretion to set standards that they deem to be appropriate for their area.\r\n\r\nAll local licensing authorities in England and Wales have a duty to ensure that any person to whom they grant a taxi or PHV driver’s licence is a fit and proper person to hold such a licence. Although the term ‘fit and proper’ is not defined in legislation, the procedure for assessing a driver’s fitness will typically involve an enhanced criminal record check and a medical check, a local topographical knowledge test and possibly a special driving test.\r\n\r\nThe Government publishes Best Practice Guidance to assist licensing authorities when setting standards for taxi and PHVs drivers and operators. The Government has introduced an amendment to the Policing and Crime Bill that will make statutory all aspects of the guidance related to the safeguarding of children and vulnerable adults. Both parts of the new guidance will be consulted on once the Policing and Crime Bill receives Royal Assent.\r\n\r\nLicensing authorities remain responsible for ensuring that the drivers they license remain fit and proper throughout the period of the licence. Any complaints about a driver can be investigated by the authority responsible for issuing the licence, regardless of where the driver was working at the time.\r\n\r\nIf vehicles from neighbouring areas present a problem, licensing authorities can work together to take joint enforcement action against all vehicles and drivers licensed in their combined areas. For example, in Merseyside, five licensing authorities allow each other to enforce against all vehicles and drivers across all of their areas.\r\n\r\nLegislation allows taxis to provide pre-booked journeys outside the area in which they are licensed, without a separate PHV licence. The Government considers that it is in the public interest to encourage taxis to accept fares that may take them out of the area in which they are licensed, for example to airports or train stations.\r\nThis concession has, in the past been open to abuse, with taxi drivers working predominantly accepting pre-booked fares outside the area in which they were licensed. The courts, while careful not to direct how a licensing authority should exercise its discretion to grant licences, have commented that it would be “difficult” to justify granting a taxi licence where a licensing authority knows the applicant has no intention of plying for hire in its area. It is the local licensing authority’s discretion as to whether or not to license such a vehicle, however to remain within the spirit of the legislation, the authority should consider the intended use of the licence.\r\n\r\nLocal licensing authorities are therefore able to address any local concerns that there may be about this issue. A number of local licensing authorities have already introduced a taxi ‘intended use’ policy when considering licence applications.\r\n \r\nThese policies are reducing the number of taxis working predominantly on pre-booked fares in other areas. If there are particular concerns in a specific area, these should be raised with the relevant licensing authorities.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport\r\n","created_at":"2017-01-12T13:43:32.749Z","updated_at":"2017-01-12T13:43:32.749Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":176033,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/176033.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Harvey's Army - Compulsory Microchip Scanning of Deceased Pets Found on railways","background":"Harvey's Army fully support Rory’s Mandate - To ensure that any domestic pet found on or by the tracks governed by Network Rail or Network Rail Infrastructure Limited is scanned for a microchip, details documented and the owners notified in a timely manner.","additional_details":"Rory was lost on the 3rd Dec 16.

This sets out the priorities for the future of health and care in the region building on local plans that have been developed across the Cheshire and Merseyside area, including the Caring Together Programme in Eastern Cheshire.  The plans look at supporting people to stay well, providing better coordinated services, improving hospital care and making most efficient use of resources and greater use of technology.\r\n\r\nOne of the many projects outlined in the STP is a review of how emergency care is delivered in Eastern Cheshire.
