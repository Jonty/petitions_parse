The Prime Minister has called modern slavery one of the ‘greatest human rights issues of our time’, and made clear that the international community must step up our efforts to eradicate it.  It is not acceptable that such exploitation is occurring in the 21st Century. \r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister launched a Call to Action to end modern slavery at this year’s UN General Assembly alongside 40 other countries, and committed to doubling UK aid spend in support of this objective to £150 million. We will continue to push for an increased international response, through the UN and other channels, to eliminate these horrific crimes, provide support for victims, and bring criminals to justice. In particular, we are pushing for the United Nations Security Council to take greater steps to combat slavery in conflict situations. \r\n\r\nThe UK Government shares others’ disgust and grave concern at the recent video footage apparently showing slave markets in Libya.  We welcome the Libyan government’s commitment immediately to investigate these reports and to ensure that those involved are brought to justice.   In addition, the UK has raised with the Libyan Prime Minister the importance of offering humanitarian support to migrants.  \r\n\r\nWe have consistently argued for a comprehensive approach, addressing the root causes of migration as well as their consequences.  In addition to the UK’s £150 million commitment on modern slavery, UK programmes have provided humanitarian aid to migrants and refugees, and delivered assistance in detention centres and to those rescued at sea.  We have provided specific support to women and girls, to protect them from the heightened risks of trafficking and sexual and gender based violence.  So far this year, the Department for International Development has supported more than 20,000 emergency interventions such as healthcare, funding psychosocial support, hygiene kits and safe shelter to migrants and refugees in Libya.\r\n\r\nWe have also developed a new £75m migration programme, which will specifically target migrants travelling from West Africa via the Sahel to Libya.  It will provide critical humanitarian assistance and protection and assist those along the way that may wish to return home, providing information about the dangers ahead and offering vulnerable people meaningful alternatives to the treacherous journeys to Libya and Europe.  \r\n\r\nAt the United Nations General Assembly in September, the Prime Minister committed to increasing efforts to tackle smuggling and trafficking through building the capacity of Libyan law enforcement agencies, and supporting efforts to sanction people smugglers at the UN.  \r\n\r\nThe UK has made clear at the United Nations Security Council our condemnation of these reports, and we support the recent Declaration from the EU-Africa Summit and the establishment of an EU-AU-UN Taskforce to address this dire situation to help returns.  UK programming has enabled the assisted voluntary return of over 1,400 migrants from Libya to their home countries this year, and we support further efforts in this area, including by the European Union Emergency Trust Fund for Africa.\r\n\r\nWe are clear that a sustainable improvement in the human rights situation in Libya can only be achieved under the stability of a strong and united Government, and we are actively supporting UN-led efforts to deliver a more inclusive political settlement in Libya.  As well as our support for peace mediation and stability we are providing support to improve women’s rights, civil society, municipalities, and freedom of speech.  A safe, secure and prosperous Libya that is able confidently to tackle the challenges in the region is in all our interests.\r\n\r\nThe Government looks forward to responding with fuller details on this very important issue in the forthcoming Westminster Hall Debate on Monday 18 December.\r\n\r\nForeign and Commonwealth Office","created_at":"2017-12-13T10:52:14.144Z","updated_at":"2017-12-13T10:52:14.144Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":"2017-12-18","transcript_url":"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2017-12-18/debates/D4D9004C-0D4E-4DAD-8C98-309E2C42D2E1/EnslavementOfBlackAfricans(Libya)","video_url":"http://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/71772c45-c2ba-400a-a9f3-7bcdd9400907","debate_pack_url":"http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CDP-2017-0259","overview":""}}},{"type":"petition","id":200299,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200299.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Change the GCSE English Literature exam from closed book to open book.","background":"Last year, lots of students struggled with GCSE English Literature as it was a closed book exam.

On 23 June 2016 the British people voted to leave the European Union. The referendum was the largest democratic mandate in UK political history. In the 2017 General Election more than 85% of people voted for parties committed to respecting that result.\r\n\r\nThere must be no attempts to remain inside the European Union, no attempts to rejoin it through the back door, and no second referendum.

No changes will be made to SPa policy affecting 1950s women to avoid placing an unfair burden on working people. ","details":"In 1995, after 2 years of debate in Parliament and following public consultation, the Government brought in a law to equalise men and women’s State Pension age (SPa). This increased the earliest age when a woman could claim SP from 60 to 65. The Government planned for the original change to take place over 10 years between 2010 and 2020. \r\n  \r\nHowever, life expectancy is rising. The Government recognised it needed to make further changes to keep the SP affordable. In 2011 it introduced another law to equalise men and women’s SPa more quickly. The 2011 law also brought forward the increase in everyone’s State Pension age from 65 to 66 by five and a half years. \r\n\r\nThe Government’s original plan was to increase women’s SPa by up to two years, so that men and women’s SPa would equalise in November 2018 rather than in October 2020. The Government listened to concerns, and looked to see if they could reduce the effect of the planned SPa increases. As a result they agreed to reduce the increase in women’s SPa to no more than 18 months, compared to the original 1995 timetable. This benefited almost a quarter of a million women who would otherwise have waited up to two extra years to claim their SP. This change cost £1.1 billion.\r\n\r\nThe Government has done lots to improve pensions for everyone, particularly women. Future women pensioners will benefit on average from a higher new SP payment, and from the expansion of Automatic Enrolment. A woman retiring today can still expect to receive the SP for almost three years longer than men. If SPa had not been equalised, women would spend on average over 40% of their adult life in retirement. \r\n\r\nOther possibilities have been considered. All would cost working people a significant amount. Reversing the 2011 SPa changes would cost over £30bn, whilst returning to a female SPa of 60 would cost over £70bn by 2020/21 (with £38bn needing to be found before April 2018 alone). Going back on these changes could also create a new inequality between men and women. \r\n\r\nFurther changes to SPa are not justified, given the need to use public money to help those most in need.\r\n\r\nThe Government is helping older people remain in and return to work. The number of older women in work is now at a record high. There are more than 900,000 more women aged over 50 in work than in 2010. The average age of exit for women is currently 63.6 – well above the previous women’s SPa of 60.\r\nOur ‘Fuller Working Lives Strategy: A Partnership Approach’, published in February 2017, aims to help older workers remain or return to employment, and to change employer’s attitudes.\r\n\r\nGovernment has changed the law to create the right support for our Fuller Working Lives strategy. For example it is now against the law to dismiss someone from their employment just because they reach the age of 65. Employees also have the right to request flexible working as long as they have worked continuously for the company for six months. This means people can agree a work pattern to suit their circumstances. \r\n\r\nHaving older people in work helps the economy, which in turn means more job opportunities for everybody - including young people. Evidence shows that younger and older workers are not in competition for the same jobs and a range of ages in the workforce is the best mix.\r\n\r\nThe Government also supports vulnerable people. It spends around £50 billion a year on benefits to support disabled people and people with health conditions. Whilst also providing support to carers through the payment of Carers Allowance.\r\n  \r\nSince 1995 the Government has gone to significant lengths to communicate SPa changes.\r\n \r\nOver the last 17 years the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has provided over 19 million personalised State Pension estimates.  It has encouraged people to request these as part of their long-term financial planning – after all, retirement is a life changing financial decision and people are expected to plan for this.\r\n\r\nFollowing the 1995 SPa changes the equalisation of men and women’s SPa was often reported in the media and debated at length in Parliament. DWP notified people with leaflets and carried out a pension’s education campaign between 2001 and 2004. This included information on the future equalisation of SPa. Later DWP sent individual letters to those affected. The Government made further increases to SPa in 2011 after a public consultation exercise and extensive debates in Parliament.\r\n\r\nWith Government facing increasing financial pressures, it cannot unpick the changes to SPa, some of which have been in place for 22 years. It is simply not affordable, especially when we take into account that the average woman reaching SPa last year will get a higher SP income over her lifetime than an average woman reaching SPa at any point before. \r\n\r\nThere will be no further changes to the law on this issue. This would mean working-age people, especially younger people, bearing a greater share of the cost of the pensions system. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions","created_at":"2017-09-27T13:23:08.770Z","updated_at":"2018-01-09T17:29:00.803Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":"2017-12-14","transcript_url":"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2017-12-14/debates/94129EFF-1C16-4FA7-90A9-1B78B93E327A/PensionEqualityForWomen","video_url":"http://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/74dac792-d57d-40c9-baab-d043ffd4cbb0?in=12:07:56","debate_pack_url":"http://researchbriefings.intranet.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CBP-7405","overview":""}}},{"type":"petition","id":201947,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/201947.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Change the laws governing the use of fireworks to include a ban on public use","background":"Fireworks cause alarm, distress and anxiety to many people and animals.

There is legislation in place that controls the sale, use and misuse of fireworks; we have no plans to extend this further.","details":"The Government takes the issue of firework safety very seriously. There is legislation in place relating to the supply, storage, possession and use and misuse of fireworks. This includes legislation which regulates the supply and use of fireworks, both for the general public and professional display operators. Restrictions on the sale and use of fireworks are set out under the 2003 Fireworks Act, the Fireworks Regulations 2004 and the Pyrotechnic Articles (Safety) Regulations 2015. These contain provisions to minimise the risk of fireworks harming people, property and animals. Although a small minority of people use fireworks in a dangerous, inconsiderate or anti-social manner, we believe that the majority use them sensibly and responsibly.\r\n\r\nThe Government is aware of concerns about the distress noisy fireworks can cause to individuals, as well as to livestock, pets and wildlife. Therefore, the Government urges those using fireworks to be considerate to their neighbours and give sufficient notice of firework use, particularly to those who are vulnerable such as older people, children, those with mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and those with pets and livestock. We have worked with the fireworks industry to encourage users of fireworks to give notice of their displays so that those who are vulnerable or keep animals can make arrangements for their safety.  \r\n\r\nThe Blue Cross animal charity has also produced information on animals and fireworks, which gives advice on how to avoid or reduce stress to animals when fireworks are being set off.  The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) and the Kennel Club provide similar advice on their websites concerning how to minimise the impact of fireworks use on animals.\r\nThere is already a ban on the general public from purchasing fireworks with higher levels of risk and noise and seasonal limitations on their sale. The Fireworks Regulations 2004 restrict their sale to the traditional fireworks periods around 5th November, Diwali, New Year’s Eve and the Chinese New Year. These are an important part of British tradition reflecting our history and multi-culturalism. While it is possible to buy fireworks at other times of the year, a ‘licence to sell fireworks’ is required and strict conditions are imposed outside the traditional periods. \r\n\r\nAt present any firework that exceeds 120 decibels must not be supplied to consumers. There are also low noise fireworks available that consumers can choose to buy, but we do not propose to bring in regulations to require all fireworks to be low noise. \r\n\r\nGovernment acknowledges that many people have genuine concerns about the use and, the misuse, of fireworks and the risks of firework-related injury. However, the number of injuries is low and the total number of hospital admissions caused by firework injuries has remained below 200 a year for the last 10 years. \r\n\r\nThe Government does not plan to make any changes to the way statistics relating to enforcement actions are collected. The Government believes the focus of enforcement should be on delivering necessary protections and on working with businesses, citizens and others to ensure safety.\r\n\r\nThe Government believes that the current regulations strike the right balance between the enjoyment of fireworks by the public and restricting the sale and use of fireworks for public safety reasons. \r\n\r\nThe best way to continue to reduce the distress caused by fireworks is to work with industry, retailers and others to promote the safe and responsible use of fireworks through guidance and public education and to ensure that appropriate action is taken against those that break the rules. \r\n\r\nThe obligations for the Secretary of State referred to in the e-petition, to publish a regulatory Impact Assessment and to consult interested organisations, only apply when making new regulations and we have no plans to change the legislation relating to fireworks.\r\n\r\nAs set out above, given there is already legislation in place which controls the sale and use and misuse of fireworks; we have no plans to extend this further.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy\r\n","created_at":"2017-10-27T14:39:35.017Z","updated_at":"2017-10-27T14:39:35.017Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":"2018-01-29","transcript_url":"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2018-01-29/debates/913A2227-7B51-44CD-870A-56C0A5ACAC73/Fireworks","video_url":"http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/2a1e3167-13f1-4dcc-9297-6a51f3854ac3","debate_pack_url":"","overview":""}}},{"type":"petition","id":209455,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/209455.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make Orkambi available on the NHS for people with Cystic Fibrosis","background":"Conventional CF treatments target the symptoms of CF, precision medicines like Orkambi tackle the cause of the condition.

","details":"The UK welcomes genuine visitors to the UK. The visitor route offers a huge range of activities that can be undertaken whilst a person is in the UK, including spending time with family. \r\n\r\nEvery visitor is assessed against the same Immigration Rules regardless of nationality. The only difference is where that assessment is made. Some individuals are assessed overseas by an entry clearance officer, while others are assessed at the UK border. All visitors to the UK are assessed against the Immigration Rules on a case by case basis.\r\n\r\nNationals of some non-EEA countries need a visa to visit the UK. Visas are an important part of securing the UK’s border and are an effective tool for the UK in reducing illegal immigration, tackling organised crime and protecting national security. \r\n\r\nAppendix V to the Immigration Rules sets out the requirements that a person seeking entry to the UK as a visitor must meet. This includes that a visitor must satisfy the decision maker that they are a genuine visitor who intends to leave the UK at the end of their visit and will not live in the UK for extended periods through frequent or successive visits, or make the UK their own home. They must be able to show that they are able to accommodate, support and maintain themselves during their visit without working or accessing public funds. There is flexibility in the rules for visitors to be maintained and accommodated by friends or relatives. \r\n\r\nAutomatically approving visas for a select group of people would mean that important considerations against the Immigration Rules would not be applied consistently and could raise equality concerns. It could lead to discrimination against those who do not have family members in the UK but have just as valid a reason for wishing to visit the UK.\r\n\r\nThere is also a danger of additional complexity in the assessment process around how an individual would prove that they are the family member of a British citizen. There could be unintended consequences that make the application process longer, more difficult and costly.\r\n\r\nThe Government recognises the importance of family ties. In 2015 we simplified the immigration system for people visiting the UK by consolidating the number of visitor routes from fifteen to four and providing shortened, user-friendly Immigration Rules and guidance to make the requirements easier to understand.

The government considers that shooting activities bring many benefits to the rural economy and can in many cases be beneficial for wildlife and habitat conservation. We recognise that it is vital that wildlife and habitats are respected and protected and the law is respected. We will continue work to ensure a sustainable, mutually beneficial relationship between shooting and conservation. We do have concerns that in some limited instances management practices have unwanted consequences for the wider environment.\r\n\r\nPersecution of British raptors and other wildlife\r\n\r\nAll wild birds are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. We have identified raptor persecution as a wildlife crime priority. Each wildlife crime priority has a delivery group to consider what action should be taken, and develop a plan to prevent crime, gather intelligence on offences and enforce against it. The Raptor Persecution Priority Delivery Group (RPPDG) focuses on the golden eagle, goshawk, hen harrier, peregrine, red kite and white-tailed eagle. The group is working on developing tools to help tackle raptor persecution crimes. \r\n\r\nThe National Wildlife Crime Unit, which is part-funded by Defra, monitors and gathers intelligence on illegal activities affecting raptors and assists police forces when required. Despite instances of poisoning and killing of birds of prey, populations of many species, such as the peregrine falcon, red kite and buzzard have increased. We are concerned that with respect to eliminating illegal bird of prey persecution, there are still individuals who continue to commit these crimes. We will work with all stakeholders to try to eradicate these crimes.\r\n\r\nIn particular the government takes the decline in the hen harrier population in England very seriously and is committed to securing its future. In January 2016 the hen harrier sub-group of the Defra led Upland Stakeholder Forum published the Hen Harrier Action Plan to increase the English hen harrier population. It contains six actions which individually can bring benefits for hen harriers, but when combined, underpin each other and have the potential to deliver positive outcomes. \r\n\r\nThe Action Plan was developed with senior representatives from organisations including Natural England, the Moorland Association, the National Gamekeepers’ Organisation, the Game \u0026 Wildlife Conservation Trust, National Parks England and formerly the RSPB. These organisations, led by Natural England, will monitor activities and report annually on progress to the Defra Uplands Stakeholder Forum and the UK Tasking and Co-ordinating group for Wildlife Crime. \r\n\r\nTargeted control of problem species is only one part of a complex mix of factors that can influence populations. Maintaining the balance between biodiversity and the numbers of each species is important. Defra monitors populations of a number of rare or vulnerable species where human intervention is thought to be a contributing factor in their decline, and ensures appropriate action is taken to keep their populations out of danger.   \r\n\r\nSubsidies to grouse moorland estates\r\n\r\nNeither subsidies nor agri-environment payments are paid to farmers to support shooting activities. Agri-environment schemes provide funding to support environmentally beneficial land management, including the management of habitats and work to improve water quality, facilitate carbon capture and protect our historic landscapes. Uplands, including grouse moors, have complex land ownership and tenure arrangements with many areas being designated common land with multiple beneficiaries. Hence, many of the agreements under our schemes result in funding going to grazing tenancies that are critical to the beneficial management of these areas.\r\n\r\nFlood risk, water pollution \u0026 environmental damage\r\n\r\nThe government is aware that the UK uplands have 75% of the world’s remaining heather moorland and about 13% of the world’s blanket bog. 70% of the UK’s drinking water is provided from upland catchments, and tourism brings in an estimated £1.78 billion to England’s upland national parks.  \r\n\r\nThe government recognises that healthy, active peat provides good habitat for grouse as well as numerous environmental benefits and ecosystem services. Natural England is working with landowners of grouse moors within Special Areas of Conservation to develop voluntary agreements, which include vegetation management principles for the various habitats on grouse moors. The government encourages land managers to work closely with Natural England to put voluntary agreements in place for all the benefits they bring to moor owners and to the environment.\r\n\r\nThe government is also working with moor owners and stakeholders to further improve management practices and peat condition, such as through the Blanket Bog Restoration Strategy.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","created_at":"2017-11-17T12:36:04.799Z","updated_at":"2017-11-17T12:36:04.799Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":200153,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200153.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Reduce the age of Mandatory Mammograms to age 25-30","background":"I was diagnosed with breast cancer age 36, at 37 I was told it was terminal.

The English cancer screening programmes are internationally renowned for their rigour, standard of evidence, national implementation and quality assurance.\r\n\r\nThe NHS Breast Screening Programme (NHS BSP) in England offers all women between the ages of 50 and 70 the opportunity to be screened every three years for breast cancer, in order to help detect abnormalities and reduce the number of lives lost to invasive breast cancer.  The aim of the NHS BSP is to detect breast cancer early when there is a greater chance of cure, thus reducing the number of lives lost to invasive breast cancer.  \r\n\r\nThe programme recognises that whilst early detection is the best way to reduce breast cancer mortality by giving the opportunity to offer women more treatment options, which may save lives, it accepts that there are also risks. These risks include over-diagnosis (referring women for unnecessary tests) and over-treatment (operating on women with disease which is unlikely to cause serious harm to them).  For women under the age of 50, breast screening is not very effective, especially when they have not reached the menopause.  Breast screening is offered from  the age of 50 based on the average age of menopause being 51 and that the chance of developing breast cancer increases with age.  Four out of five breast cancers develop in women over the age of 50. There is insufficient evidence to confidently offer breast screening to women at a much younger age because to do so may cause more harm than good.  Not all breast cancers can be detected early when they are non-invasive and some women with non-invasive disease would never have cancer during their lifetime. \r\n\r\nThere are several trials in the Programme addressing these issues currently:\r\n•\tForget me not www.sloaneproject.co.uk/NonTreatmentStudy.htm  \r\n•\tLoris www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/find-a-clinical-trial/a-trial-comparing-surgery-with-active-monitoring-for-low-risk-dcis-loris\r\n•\t Sloane www.sloaneproject.co.uk/. \r\n \r\nThe 2012 UK independent review of breast cancer screening (Marmot review) estimated that inviting women between the ages of 50-70 reduces mortality from breast cancer in the population invited by 20% and saves an estimated 1,300 lives a year.  It also found that screening women outside the ages of 50 to 70 years could lead to over-diagnosis or over-treatment. To read the review, please visit: http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/prod_consump/groups/cr_common/@nre/@pol/documents/generalcontent/breast-screening-report.pdf \r\n\r\nIn June 2015, the World Health Organisation’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) published the findings of a review on breast cancer screening in the New England Journal of Medicine. A group of 29 independent international experts from 16 countries, convened by the IARC, assessed the cancer-preventive and adverse effects of various methods of screening for breast cancer. The findings of the review support the current age at which women are first invited for breast screening in England and the three year interval period between invitations. The IARC’s review found that the evidence for the effectiveness of screening women in the younger age group of 40 to 49 was limited. Women aged over 70 are not routinely invited for breast screening because there is no evidence to support this, although they are entitled to self-refer every three years if they wish. You review can be accessed here: www.iarc.fr/en/mediacentre/pr/2015/pdfs/pr234_E.pdf\r\n\r\nIn 2008, the age extension trial began to investigate into whether extending screening to 47-49 and 71-73 year olds is clinically and cost effective. This trial is led by researchers at the University of Oxford and will provide robust evidence about the effectiveness of screening in these age groups, which will include the benefit and harms. The trial is expected to report in 2020. \r\n\r\nWomen that are identified as being at high risk of the disease (e.g. due to a genetic mutation such as BRCA1/2 or having had supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy at a young age) can be referred into the programme at a younger age. However, for this younger cohort, screening is usually performed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which is a more suitable screening test than mammography alone.\r\n \r\nWe encourage all women to be breast aware and anyone with concerns should discuss these with their General Practitioner. \r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2017-09-26T14:00:15.161Z","updated_at":"2017-09-26T14:00:15.161Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":200000,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200000.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make British Sign Language part of the National Curriculum","background":"Around 50,000 people in the UK use British Sign Language, so why is this not taught in schools?

Due to the increasing cost, NHSE is leading a review of medicines which can be considered as being of low clinical value and develop new guidance for Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs). \r\n \r\nOn 21 July, NHSE launched a three month consultation on the draft guidance on low value prescription items which is based on the latest clinical evidence, including that from the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE).  Careful consideration has been given to ensure that particular groups of people are not disproportionately affected, and that principles of best practice on clinical prescribing are adhered to.\r\n \r\nThe commissioning guidance, upon which NHSE is consulting, will be addressed to CCGs to support them to fulfil their duties around the appropriate use of prescribing resources. This will need to be taken into account by CCGs in adopting or amending their own local guidance to their clinicians in primary care.\r\n \r\nThe aim of this consultation is to provide individuals with information about the proposed national guidance and to seek people’s views about the proposals.  NHSE welcomes the views of the public, patients, clinicians, commissioners and providers through this consultation process to help inform the final guidance. The consultation ends on 21 October. Links to the consultation can be found here: \r\nhttps://www.england.nhs.uk/2017/07/medicine-consultation/ and\r\nhttps://www.engage.england.nhs.uk/consultation/items-routinely-prescribed/\r\n\r\nIt is the responsibility of local NHS organisations to make decisions on the commissioning and funding of any healthcare treatments for NHS patients, such as homeopathy, taking account of issues to do with safety, clinical and cost-effectiveness and the availability of suitably qualified and regulated practitioners.\r\n \r\nComplementary and alternative medicine (CAMs) treatments can, in principle, feature in a range of services offered by local NHS organisations. A treating clinician would take into account an individual’s circumstances and medical history in deciding what would be the most appropriate treatment for their condition. CCGs will have specific policies on the commissioning and funding of CAMs, and may have also developed local policies on priorities with regards to the funding of treatments. A GP would have to work within such policies in providing any treatments on the NHS.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Health supports an approach to evidence-based prescribing which does not support the commissioning of services which are not clinically and cost effective. We are not aware of any evidence that demonstrates the therapeutic effectiveness of homeopathic products. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) does not currently recommend that homeopathy should be used in the treatment of any health condition, whilst primary care prescribing data shows that there has been a significant decline in the prescribing of homeopathic products over the last 10 years. Furthermore, a good number of NHS organisations are reviewing their funding of homeopathic treatments and some have already stopped funding such treatment altogether.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2017-10-12T15:49:45.456Z","updated_at":"2017-10-12T15:49:45.456Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":200793,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200793.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Cancel HS2 immediately and repeal the 2013 and 2017 High Speed Rail Acts.","background":"HS2 is a vanity project, lobbied for by the firms who will make billions out of building it, at a time of continued austerity and cuts to essential services.

It is on time and on budget.","details":"New Railway\r\n\r\nHS2 will form the new backbone of our national rail network, providing new capacity and better connecting our major cities, while creating more space for commuter and freight trains on our busiest lines. This will create better connections and more seats for passengers and allow more goods to be moved by rail, which will also help to improve air quality.\r\n\r\nOpening in 2026, the HS2 network will serve towns and cities including London, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield, Crewe, Nottingham, Derby, York and Newcastle, with trains running on to Scotland. By 2033 up to 18 trains an hour will run in both directions, carrying up to 1,100 passengers each. \r\n\r\nHS2 is a major investment but an essential one. HS2’s total budget is £55.7bn. Over the current Spending Review period spending on HS2 will equate to 0.14% of GDP. We are keeping a tough grip on costs and are determined to deliver HS2 on time and on budget.\r\n\r\nBenefits to the North\r\n\r\nWe are delivering unprecedented investment in infrastructure in the North, to redress the historic imbalance in infrastructure investment between north and south. The Northern Powerhouse is a key priority, and our substantial investment will boost the northern economy and reduce the prosperity gap with the South that has existed for far too long.\r\n\r\nWe are also working to future-proof HS2 by including provisions for new junctions in the North and Midlands, which will help ensure that the infrastructure can accommodate the Northern powerhouse. HS2 will transform capacity and connectivity for millions of people across the north. With HS2 stations in Manchester, Leeds, Crewe and Sheffield, the north will be the principal beneficiary of HS2. \r\n\r\nHS2 will underpin the plans of local areas to grow their economies, in places like Leeds where the South Bank regeneration project around Leeds station is expected to support 35,000 jobs across key sectors and 4,000 new homes. HS2 will generate around £25 billion of contracts and represents a major opportunity for businesses across the whole of the UK including small and medium-sized enterprises.\r\n\r\nThe Government has committed £60m to take HS3, or Northern Powerhouse Rail, forward and we are working closely with Transport for the North to develop a business case for the project by the end of 2018. The Government is investing over £13bn in the north of England’s transport infrastructure, including on roads and railways, to deliver faster journeys and increased capacity. That work will continue apace and is a key priority for the Department.\r\n\r\nThis includes dramatically improving journeys for passengers across the north with the Great North Rail Project. By 2020, as a result of this ambitious and comprehensive upgrade, passengers will benefit from faster and more comfortable journeys, as well as new direct services across the north and beyond. We are also developing options for the Transpennine Route Upgrade, to increase the number of seats, and reduce journey times, allowing journeys such as from Leeds to Manchester in 40 minutes. \r\n\r\nHS2 is key to the future of our transport system and the relationship it has with our existing network is a vital part of our planning.  It is not a case of “either/or” but rather one of joined up and complementary delivery.  Over £38 billion is being spent on improving the existing rail network for the five years between 2014 and 2019.  This investment is funding projects to increase capacity on the existing rail network and improve journeys for all passengers. There is also potential for HS2 to increase the amount of freight transported by rail – meaning fewer cars and lorries on our roads, cutting congestion and carbon.\r\n\r\nCreating Jobs and skills\r\n\r\nHS2 will support growth in the wider economy, worth an additional 100,000 jobs. 70% of all jobs created by HS2 will be outside of London. But this isn’t just about when the new railway opens - jobs and skills are being created now. \r\n\r\nSeveral contracts have already been let and major contracts for up to £11.8 billion worth for the civil engineering work will be let this year. HS2 is working with businesses across the UK - including many small and medium-sized firms - to ensure they are well prepared to bid for work on HS2. HS2 will generate around 25,000 jobs during construction as well as 2,000 apprenticeships.\r\n\r\nAnd HS2 is about upskilling: a more skilled workforce is vital for the country as we forge a bold new positive role for ourselves in the world. The National College for High Speed Rail, based in Doncaster and Birmingham, will open its doors later this month. The College will train young people to build HS2 and other world-leading rail projects. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport","created_at":"2017-10-11T16:46:55.405Z","updated_at":"2017-10-11T16:46:55.405Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":202588,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/202588.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Stop the cuts to the Royal Marines and the Royal Navy's amphibious assault ships","background":"This petition calls on the Government to stop cuts to Devonport-based HMS Albion \u0026 HMS Bulwark.

It provides almost a third of our electricity., 85% of households in England have gas central heating, and 19% of our gas is used in industry, for power and heat and as feedstock for a wide range of chemical products including many items found in our homes including pharmaceuticals and plastics. \r\n\r\nSince 2000, UK gas production has decreased and we are becoming increasingly dependent on imports. We currently import just under half of the gas we use and by 2030 it is predicted we will import 72% of the gas we consume.  Shale gas is a potential new source of domestic gas, which can provide local jobs and growth. \r\n\r\nWe are clear that shale gas development must be done in a safe manner.  Our regulatory system uses existing regulators with long-standing experience of regulating across different sectors in their area of specialisation. Each regulator specialises in the aspect that they oversee, such as health and safety or the environment, they can bring to bear extensive knowledge and experience gained from their work in other sectors as well as oil and gas. The Government’s position draws on independent reviews by the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering, and Public Health England. These reports have considered a wide range of evidence and looked at the UK regulatory system. The Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering concluded: “the risks can be managed effectively in the UK, if operational best practices are implemented and enforced through regulation.” \r\n\r\n\r\nEarly engagement is vital with communities who may be affected by shale gas developments and we acknowledge that public confidence in the process is important to the success of the industry. To increase understanding of hydraulic fracturing, we have worked closely with industry and regulators to improve public engagement. \r\n\r\nThe industry body – the UK Onshore Operators Group (UKOOG) – has established a Community Engagement Charter. All shale gas operators will engage local communities, residents and other stakeholders at and ahead of each of three stages – exploration, appraisal and production. This is in addition to consultation through the planning and environmental permit applications. \r\n\r\nIn addition, regulators hold regular drop-in events in local communities with shale gas prospects, to explain how the industry is regulated.  \r\n\r\nWe will continue to work with industry and regulators to ensure the public has access to factual information on hydraulic fracturing and proposed shale developments. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy","created_at":"2017-10-27T11:03:28.217Z","updated_at":"2017-10-27T11:03:28.217Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":202243,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/202243.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Change the law to ban the resale of tickets for more than their face value","background":"Tickets are being bought from sites and are getting sold to third party sellers for a high price meaning real fans are missing out.

The Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2016 (TSRGD) sets out the design and conditions of use for traffic signs that may be used on roads in England, Scotland and Wales. \r\n\r\nTraffic signs use symbols which enable drivers to take in the information quickly and understand the meaning of the sign. Symbols are often internationally recognised which is important for all road users, especially those who may be unfamiliar to the area. \r\n\r\nIn the case of a directional sign to a leisure facility (such as a football ground), the symbols used are a general representation of the activity being depicted. As such, drivers can then quickly understand the type of destination. The football ground symbol first appeared in TSRGD in 1994 and road users have become accustomed to its use.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of traffic signs is to “convey warnings, information, requirements, restrictions or prohibitions” (Section 64 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984). \r\nThe Department for Transport commissioned research into road user’s understanding of traffic signs in 2011. This concluded that respondents “showed a good basic level of understanding as to what different types of sign meant” and recommended that signs should be kept simple.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of a traffic sign is not to raise public appreciation and awareness of geometry which is better dealt with in other ways. If the correct geometry were put onto a sign, it would only be visible close up and not from the distance at which drivers will see the sign. The detail of the geometry would also not be taken in by most drivers who were merely looking at the sign for direction. The higher level of attention needed to understand the geometry could distract a driver’s view away from the road for longer than necessary which could therefore increase the risk of an incident.\r\n\r\nAdditionally the public funding required to change every football sign nationally would place an unreasonable financial burden on local authorities.

The NMC state that “Programme providers must ensure that students are supernumerary during all practice learning. Supernumerary means that the student will not, as part of their programme of preparation, be contracted by any person or body to provide nursing care”.  \r\n\r\nIt is our view that students' completion of high-quality clinical placements is essential to having a well-trained workforce for the NHS. As a result and in addition to the expenses system already in place and run by the higher education student support system, we have made additional funding available for pre-registration nursing, midwifery and allied health profession students with the purpose of maintaining access to clinical placements and other areas associated with compulsory study. \r\n\r\nWe will also provide students with funding for unavoidable costs incurred for temporary accommodation with the purpose of maintaining access to clinical placements and other areas associated with compulsory study. \r\n\r\nThe funding reforms will not change the arrangement of students being supernumerary whilst on clinical placements and they will not be paid for their clinical learning.\r\n\r\nQuality assurance mechanisms should therefore be in place at all placement providers to enable students to provide feedback and raise concerns about their supernumerary status possibly being compromised. \r\n\r\nHealth Education England is currently piloting the Nursing Associate role with 35 pilot sites training 2,000 Nursing Associates.

The Mayor is responsible for much of London’s public transport and road network, the licensing of its taxis and regulation of its traffic. The Mayor also has responsibilities for London’s environment, its housing, planning, regeneration and economic development. Through the Mayor’s office for Policing and Crime the Mayor performs the duties of Police and Crime Commissioner for London; the Mayor is also responsible for fire and rescue services in the capital. \r\n\r\nThe Mayor of London is accountable directly to London’s electorate for his decisions. It is London households who pay the additional precept set by the Mayor, which is charged to meet the Mayor’s costs, over and above each London Borough’s council tax bill. It is essential that those who are affected by the mayor’s taxing decisions have a direct, democratic choice on who the Mayor is, and the ability, if they choose, to elect a different one at the next opportunity. The Mayor of London then governs in the awareness that their electoral mandate comes directly from the people the mayor serves.\r\n\r\nA London Mayor whose electoral mandate comes from the whole nation may seek to serve the interests of voters in the UK as a whole, rather than those of Londoners.

Raw cannabis is not recognised in the UK as having any medicinal benefit.  ","details":"There is clear scientific and medical evidence that cannabis is a harmful drug which can damage people’s mental and physical health, and harms individuals and communities.  The evidence from the Government’s independent experts, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), is that the use of cannabis is a ‘significant public health issue and can unquestionably cause harm to individuals and society’. \r\n\r\nThe decriminalisation of drugs in the UK would not eliminate the crime committed by the illicit trade nor would it address the harms associated with drug dependence and the misery this can cause to families and society.  Decriminalisation or legalisation of cannabis would send the wrong message to the vast majority of people who do not take drugs, especially young and vulnerable people, with the potential grave risk of increased misuse of drugs. \r\n \r\nWhen a police officer finds someone in possession of drugs, it is an operational matter as to the appropriate response.  We have confidence in our police officers to assess as appropriate any enforcement action, where there is a public order or protection or local drug issue that needs addressing, rather than seek them out for drug possession offences.  It is not always appropriate or conducive to the public good to arrest every person they find with a small amount of cannabis and although the police can charge individuals with a criminal offence, they can also issue a warning or an on-the-spot fine of £90 if an individual is found with cannabis. \r\n\r\nIt is important that medicines are thoroughly tested to ensure they meet rigorous standards before being placed on the market, so that doctors and patients are sure of their efficacy, quality and safety.  There is a clear regime in place administered by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (‘MHRA’) to enable medicines (including controlled drugs such as cannabis) to be developed, licensed and made available for medicinal use to patients in the UK.  For example, the cannabis-based medicine ‘Sativex’ has been granted Marketing Authorisation in the UK by the MHRA for the treatment of spasticity due to multiple sclerosis.  Sativex was tested for its safety, efficacy and quality before receiving Marketing Authorisation approval for this application. \r\n\r\nThe MHRA is open to considering marketing authorisation approval applications for other medicinal cannabis products should a product be developed by a manufacturer.  As happened in the case of Sativex, the Home Office will consider issuing a licence to enable trials of any new medicine, providing it complies with the appropriate ethical approvals. \r\n\r\nWe continue to monitor international developments on the evidence base around cannabis.  The World Health Organisation’s Expert Committee on Drug Dependence has committed to reviewing the scheduling of cannabis under the UN’s 1961 Convention.

Our vision for care must also incorporate the wider networks of support and services which help older people to live independently, including the crucial role of housing and the interaction with other public services.  It must consider how care is provided at present and challenge the system to embrace new technology, innovation and workforce models which can deliver better quality and value.\r\n\r\nTo deliver a lasting solution, it is right that we take the time needed to debate these complex issues and listen to a range of perspectives to build consensus.  For this reason, over the coming months, we will work with experts, stakeholders, people using care and support services, and carers to shape the long-term reform which is urgently needed.  The Government has already established an Inter-Ministerial Group to oversee development of the Green Paper, and as part of this initial engagement we have asked a number of independent experts in this area to provide their views to the group.  The Government will also engage closely with representatives from local government, the NHS, the voluntary sector and care providers, as well as with people who use care and support and carers, to underpin development of the Green Paper.  And when the Green Paper is published, it will then be subject to a full public consultation, providing a further opportunity for interested parties to give their views.\r\n\r\nWhilst the Green Paper will focus on care for older people, the Government recognises both the challenges faced by people of working age with care needs and the many common questions about the sustainability of the care system.  Many of the discussions on the Green Paper reforms will impact on care and support for adults of all ages.  However, to ensure that issues for working-age adults with care needs are considered in their own right, the Government will take forward a parallel programme of work, led jointly by the Department of Health and the Department for Communities and Local Government, which will focus on this group.  This work will also be overseen by the Inter-Ministerial Group to ensure alignment with the Green Paper.\r\n\r\nThe Green Paper presents a unique opportunity to build consensus around reforms which can last. There is no escaping that building a sustainable care and support system will require choices about what that system should provide and how it is paid for.  But getting this right promises a better system that everyone can have confidence in, where people understand their responsibilities, can prepare for the future, and know that the care they receive will be to a high standard and help them maintain their independence and wellbeing.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2017-11-24T14:46:39.794Z","updated_at":"2017-11-24T14:46:39.794Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":200394,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200394.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Investigate covert foreign interference in the EU referendum","background":"It is becoming clear that the US 2016 election was the target of Russian efforts to influence the result, for instance via large numbers of fake social media accounts.\r\n\r\nThere is some evidence (eg http://ind.pn/2wuMo48 ) that the EU referendum was similarly targeted; a full investigation is needed.","additional_details":"It is important that the full scale of any manipulation is made public, so that trust in democracy in the UK is restored and necessary precautions can be developed.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that in the US/German cases, spreading fear of immigrants has been a major tactic (http://nyti.ms/2xonxTw)\r\n\r\nGerman BfV statement: (16 Nov 2016) http://reut.rs/2gZS17j\r\n\r\nThe Fake Americans Russia Created to Influence the Election (7 Sep 2017) http://nyti.ms/2wflmT6\r\n\r\nEU referendum: (14 Dec 2016) http://ind.pn/2i2Jeh5","state":"open","signature_count":19093,"created_at":"2017-09-15T09:41:52.598Z","updated_at":"2018-02-05T21:46:50.766Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-09-19T16:42:34.444Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-09-15T11:22:07.067Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2017-10-30T21:25:06.851Z","government_response_at":"2017-11-16T11:52:14.290Z","debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Adam Bernard","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"As the Prime Minister stated in her speech at Mansion House on 13th November 2017, the first duty of Government is to safeguard the nation.

This includes a requirement on businesses not to subject anyone to misleading or aggressive marketing practices, or, for example, direct exhortation to buy products, such as games content, including in-game purchases such as loot boxes. The government is committed to ensuring that consumers are properly protected and that children’s vulnerability and inexperience is not exploited by aggressive commercial practices.\r\n\r\nThe Video Standards Council (VSC) Rating Board is the designated body for classifying video games, and applies the Europe-wide PEGI ratings to video games supplied in the UK. The PEGI criteria currently make provision for games depicting simulations of traditional gambling, and such games would generally attract a minimum PEGI rating of 12. The VSC Rating Board is discussing these issues with the PEGI Council and its Experts Group to determine whether any changes to the PEGI criteria need to be made.\r\n\r\nThe Gambling Commission monitors the participation of children in gambling through a range of data sources including complaints, academic research and the annual Young People and Gambling Survey, which in 2017 included specific questions in relation to eSports and video gaming. The results of the survey are due to be published soon. The Gambling Commission has also asked the Responsible Gambling Strategy Board to examine the wider relationship between children and gambling. \r\n\r\nOn 11 October the government published the Internet Safety Strategy, setting out plans to make the UK the safest place in the world to be online. The Strategy outlines how the government will work with online platforms, game publishers and game developers, and with agencies such as the VSC Rating Board, to continue to improve online safety in games. This includes promoting further awareness and understanding of PEGI age ratings, parental controls and advice on safe gaming.\r\n\r\nThe government recognises the risks that come from increasing convergence between gambling and video games. The Gambling Commission is keeping this matter under review and will continue to monitor developments in the market.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport","created_at":"2017-10-25T12:17:40.535Z","updated_at":"2017-11-01T10:46:47.128Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":200213,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200213.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Abolish Universal Credits before it puts majority of the UK in poverty","background":"The new Universal Credit replaces JSA, Income Support, ESA, Housing Benefit, Tax Credits and Working Tax Credits.\r\n\r\nBILLIONS taken from the needy and most vulnerable in society.","additional_details":"Universal Credit is about cutting the Social Security bill meaning millions will be worse off. \r\nOnce fully implemented Universal Credit will mean easier sanctioning forcing people to live off nothing. \r\nHousing subsidy will be time limited for some 18-21 year olds forcing more to be homeless. \r\nSupport for child care drastically cut. \r\nDisability elements cut or abolished altogether. \r\nThousands of small businesses will be forced out of business. \r\nSome rates are lower than current benefit rates.","state":"open","signature_count":16370,"created_at":"2017-09-13T22:21:05.588Z","updated_at":"2018-02-05T23:41:00.253Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-09-20T16:29:27.207Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-09-13T22:44:30.201Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2017-10-30T22:38:39.408Z","government_response_at":"2017-11-15T10:33:53.485Z","debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Michelle Walsh","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"Universal Credit is simplifying the system to ensure that work always pays and more people are moving into work as a result. Personalised support is available and targeted at those that need it most.","details":"The best way to help people out of poverty is to help them into work. Work is the pillar of a strong economy and a strong society and we believe that work should always pay, that we should have a welfare system that helps people into work, supports people who need help, and is fair to those who pay for it. \r\n\r\nThe old system which UC is replacing is complicated, inflexible and involves different agencies and Government departments. This complexity would often mean that people were put off from taking up offers of employment or taking on more hours.\r\n\r\nUniversal Credit is revolutionising the welfare system by making work pay. It simplifies the system and provides a single payment for people in or out of work which ensures that people are always better off working and better off working more. There are none of the cliff edges or complicated hours rules of the old system, just a single, simple, taper so payments reduce in a transparent and predictable way as earnings increase.\r\n\r\nUniversal Credit provides unprecedented level of personalised support. People receive tailored support managed through personal work coaches, who know each person’s case and have more tools than ever before to help people prepare for work and get a job. \r\n\r\nWe know this is having a positive impact on employment outcomes, it’s been proven by three separate research studies. Compared to the old system, people on Universal Credit are more likely to be in work after 6 months, spend more time looking for a job, more time looking to increase their earnings and will actually consider work they wouldn’t have considered doing before.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Government recognises that high childcare costs can affect parents’ decisions to take up paid work or increase their working hours. We increased the level of support for childcare costs within Universal Credit from 70 per cent to 85 per cent. The intention is that families will get more out of the money that they earn, and will find that it pays to get a job, from taking the first step back into work, right up to working full-time.\r\n\r\nWe want to make sure that Universal Credit is fair to claimants and to the taxpayer that funds it, and that support is targeted at those that need it most. Each jobseeker receiving UC takes on a ‘commitment’ or ‘contract' which is the obligation to look for and take on work, and in return receive the benefit payment as planned. This clearly sets out what is expected of jobseekers, the support they get to move into work and the consequences of not adhering to the requirements, which can include sanctions. All requirements that are set are reasonable and achievable for each individual claimant, taking their circumstances into account. \r\n\r\nWe want to ensure that 18 to 21-year-olds do not slip straight into a life on benefits, which is why we are helping young people get the training, skills and experience they need to move into a job and build a career. The change to housing costs support for this group will ensure young people in the benefit system face the same choices as young people who work but may not be able to afford to leave home. We know that personal circumstances will differ so we have worked closely with stakeholders to develop a fair and robust set of exemptions to protect the most vulnerable young people.\r\n\r\nUniversal Credit aims to support all people to participate fully in society, including remaining in or returning to work. Many disabled people want to work but feel the risk of losing their benefits is too great. Part of the design of Universal Credit is to simplify the current provision in legacy benefits so that Universal Credit is simpler to understand and deliver, and less prone to fraud and error. Rather than replicate every aspect of disability provision in the current legacy system, we have removed the complexity of dealing with different rules for seven different disability additions. There will also be transitional protection for those claimants with existing premiums whose circumstances do not change who move over to Universal Credit as part of the managed migration process, if their overall entitlement would be less than under the old system.\r\n\r\nThe Government recognises the importance of self-employment and small businesses to the economy and to society. As part of the Government’s wider growth strategy, we are keen to help self-employed people to achieve their potential and progress in work. We are also keen to support new enterprise and there is a range of support for small businesses such as the new Enterprise Allowance. Universal Credit supports people into self-employment where it is the best route for them to become financially self-sufficient. The aim is to increase the number of people progressing from low earning self-employment and becoming more self-sufficient in the long term and to encourage those reporting very low self-employed income to increase their earnings. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions","created_at":"2017-11-15T10:33:53.482Z","updated_at":"2017-11-15T11:30:18.722Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":205348,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/205348.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Pass legislation making animals legally \"Sentient Beings\" in UK law.","background":"Following the failure of the House of Commons to support the transfer of the EU Protocol on animal sentience in Article 13 of Title II of Lisbon Treaty into UK law, we demand primary legislation making animals legally \"sentient beings\" in UK law.","additional_details":"","state":"open","signature_count":16343,"created_at":"2017-11-16T12:04:42.452Z","updated_at":"2018-02-05T20:15:04.344Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-11-23T10:27:23.998Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-11-16T13:36:14.578Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2017-11-26T12:20:31.450Z","government_response_at":"2017-12-18T15:11:46.387Z","debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Robert Webber","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"The government is committed to the very highest standards of animal welfare as we leave the EU. We have published a draft Bill which clearly recognises animal sentience in domestic law.","details":"The government is committed to the very highest standards of animal welfare as we leave the EU. As the Secretary of State set out in his Written Ministerial Statement on 12 December, there was never any question that this government’s policies on animal welfare are driven by the fact that animals are sentient beings. We have published a draft Bill which underlines the government’s commitment to raising animal welfare standards. The draft Animal Welfare (Sentencing and Recognition of Sentience) Bill increases the maximum prison sentence for animal cruelty tenfold to 5 years in prison and clearly recognises animal sentience in domestic law. The Bill also requires UK government Ministers to have regard to the welfare needs of animals when formulating and implementing government policy. We are currently seeking views on the draft Bill.  Anyone who wishes to comment has until 31 January 2018 to do so.  \r\n\r\nArticle 13 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) has not delivered the progress we want to see. It only applies to the implementation and formulation of EU-level policy and has had minimal impact even in those areas. Our draft Bill is a significant improvement, both recognising animal sentience and imposing a clear duty on the state to have regard for animal welfare. Ultimately, Article 13 has failed to prevent practices across the EU which are cruel and painful to animals. \r\n\r\nIn contrast, here in the UK, we are already improving animal welfare standards without EU input and beyond the scope of Article 13. We are making CCTV mandatory in all slaughterhouses – a requirement which goes above and beyond any EU rule. We propose combatting elephant poaching with a ban on the ivory trade which is more comprehensive than anywhere else in Europe. Our ban on microbeads which harm marine animals has been welcomed by Greenpeace as “the strongest in the world”, and is certainly the strongest in Europe. \r\n\r\nThis Government will continue to promote and enhance animal welfare, both now and after we have left the EU.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment.

While the UK remains a member of the EU, we remain committed to budgetary restraint and ensuring that we live within the 2013 deal on the Multiannual Financial Framework.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister also acknowledged in her Florence Speech that we will want to continue working with the EU in ways that promote the long-term economic development of our continent.
