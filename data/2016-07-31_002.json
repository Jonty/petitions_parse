However, concern was expressed by some that the use of planning conditions to require archaeological excavations would be curtailed by the Bill.   This interpretation does not accurately represent the Government’s intention.\r\n\r\nThe proposed power is to help address the urgent need to tackle the overuse of ‘pre-commencement’ conditions which prevent development, including new homes, from starting until the local planning authority has approved certain details.  The measure will not restrict the ability of local planning authorities to propose conditions that are necessary. In the unlikely event that an applicant refuses to accept a necessary pre-commencement condition proposed by a local planning authority, the authority can refuse planning permission. This will maintain appropriate protections for important matters such as heritage, as well as human health, the natural environment, green spaces, and measures to mitigate the risk of flooding. \r\n\r\nWe are not proposing that all pre-commencement conditions are removed; only that they are used proportionately and provide the applicant with an opportunity to agree to them before they are attached to planning permission.  The process envisaged by the Government is that the local planning authority will notify applicants of any proposed pre-commencement conditions before the determination of an application.  Most applicants are already aware of likely conditions through early engagement with the authority, at which point they can challenge any pre-commencement conditions which may be unnecessary or can be fulfilled at a later date (i.e. during build); ensuring construction can go ahead without delay.\r\n \r\nThe National Planning Policy Framework remains unchanged in that it requires “developers to record and advance understanding of the significance of any heritage assets to be lost (wholly or in part) in a manner proportionate to their importance and the impact, and to make this evidence (and any archive generated) publicly accessible.”\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the Government values the petition in highlighting the importance of archaeology and the historic environment as a material consideration in the planning process, and will continue to engage fully with the sector during the passage of the Bill and beyond. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Communities and Local Government","created_at":"2016-06-07T15:25:42.063Z","updated_at":"2016-06-07T15:25:42.063Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":124333,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/124333.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Save UK Air Cadet Gliding","background":"On March 10th 2016 it was announced that Gliding for UK Air Cadet Organization was being scaled back with heavy cuts to its locations and fleet.

Our reforms to the special educational needs and disabilities system emphasise providing tailored support to meet pupils’ specific needs. The reforms encourage close working with parents and pupils to make sure the support that pupils need is identified early. We work with, and provide funding to, dyslexia organisations to help to ensure that these pupils get the necessary support. \r\n\r\nIt is essential that all pupils leave primary school with the skills to succeed in secondary school. Pupils who can spell quickly and precisely are able to write down their ideas fluently and accurately, freeing them to concentrate on the meaning of what they want to say. Spelling is therefore a vital element of the National Curriculum at both key stages and is included as part of the teacher assessments of writing in Year 2 and Year 6. \r\n\r\nThe new interim teacher assessment framework for Key Stage 2 (KS2) is designed to assess the extent to which pupils have gained a secure grounding in the National Curriculum before they move on to the next stage of their education. This will be assessed by the pupils’ teachers. In writing, to meet the ‘expected standard’ pupils must be able to spell most words accurately, using the detailed spelling rules and guidance in the KS2 programme of study. The statutory KS2 wordlists are made up of words that we know pupils frequently misspell. \r\n\r\nThese assessments form part of the information used to help teachers and parents understand how pupils are performing against national expectations. They also allow us to hold schools to account for how well they have supported all their pupils to reach the expected standard.\r\n\r\nAssessment by pupils’ teachers at the end of Year 6 provides the secondary schools with accurate information on their new Year 7 pupils. The secondary schools can then effectively support all the pupils who did not meet the expected standard to achieve their full potential. They cannot respond quickly to these pupils’ needs if the assessment information they receive does not reflect accurately what pupils know and can do.\r\n\r\nOur approach applies to all pupils, including those with dyslexia, because it is in these pupils’ best interests that teachers assess accurately what they can or cannot do. \r\n\r\nStatutory assessments, however, form only part of the broader assessments that teachers continually make. Schools should report statutory assessment outcomes in the context of wider information about pupils’ overall achievements and progress across the whole curriculum.    \r\n\r\nDepartment for Education","created_at":"2016-05-04T13:58:31.211Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T13:58:31.211Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":159996,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/159996.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Parliament should hold Tony Blair to account for the war in Iraq","background":"The Chilcot Report has presented a range of evidence that demonstrates that Parliament and the country were misled by Tony Blair in the run up to the war in Iraq.

Domestic tests must comply with these requirements which set out what, as a minimum, should be tested. \r\n\r\nThe Directive specifies that the theory test should cover, amongst other items, ‘other road users’ “specific risk factors related to the lack of experience of other road users and the most vulnerable categories of users such as children, pedestrians, cyclists and people whose mobility is reduced”.\r\n\r\nLearner drivers must pass a theory test before they are able to take their practical driving test. The theory test consists of two parts; a multiple choice test and a hazard perception test. Both parts of the test address the knowledge of how to behave around horses and horse riders on the road, as stated in ‘The Highway Code’ and in ‘The Official DVSA Guide to Driving; the essential skills’.\r\n\r\nThe hazard perception test is a test of candidates’ ability to identify developing hazards in a series of on-road video clips viewed from the driver’s seat. The test currently includes clips showing horses and riders on the road and further clips are being developed. Although the main focus at the moment is to increase the representation of severe weather conditions in the test, the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) will consider broadening the range of horse and rider clips working alongside The British Horse Society.\r\n\r\nWithin the practical driving test the DVSA’s examiners can only test candidates on certain circumstances that occur during the test. There is more chance of a horse and rider being encountered on a test in a rural environment than in a city environment. If a candidate did encounter, during their test, a situation such as either having to pass a horse and its rider or approaching one, the examiner will assess the candidate’s actions in dealing safely with that situation. \r\n\r\nMany learner drivers would be more likely, depending on where they live and are taking the test, to encounter such situations during their driving lesson, rather than during their practical test.

Dickinson","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"Woodland cover in England is at its highest level since the 14th century. The National Planning Policy Framework provides strong protection for ancient woodlands.","details":"Our ancient woodlands are highly valued and cherished, and are a resource rich in life, providing homes and food for animals, birds and insects. They store carbon, produce oxygen and filter out pollution; they also provide some of the most interesting places for us to enjoy. We know that ancient woodlands are an irreplaceable habitat, which is why we recognise their special status in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), which was last updated in 2012.\r\n\r\nSince the Second World War, great efforts have been made to restore and actively manage our ancient woodlands. The ancient woodland inventory estimates approximately 340,000 hectares of woodland in England that is ancient. Subsequent estimates suggest that there are about 210,000 hectares of native woodland not on ancient woodland sites. Taken together, those two categories of woodland comprise just over half of England’s woodlands, at about 550,000 hectares.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have ambitions to increase woodland cover and improve the quality of our woodland management, we must be mindful that those ambitions sit alongside a need to increase food production, create renewable energy and capture carbon, while also maintaining the habitats that our wildlife depends on, such as our ancient woodlands. In order to compete globally economically, we need to update and upgrade our ageing infrastructure and ensure that development enables our economic growth to be sustained.\r\n\r\nWe have, however, always made a special case for our ancient woodland, which is why they are protected in the NPPF. The passage that deals with them clearly states:\r\n\r\n“Planning permission should be refused for development resulting in the loss or deterioration of irreplaceable habitats, including ancient woodland and … veteran trees … unless the need for, and benefits of, the development in that location clearly outweigh the loss”.\r\n\r\nThe position is very clear: there is protection. The Government certainly has no plans to undermine or change that position; figures from the Woodland Trust itself suggest that less than 0.25% of ancient woodland has been developed in the last 15 years, which indicates that this protection is working. Nevertheless, Natural England has been working with the Forestry Commission to produce refreshed guidance for all planning authorities to help them take full and proper account of ancient woodland in the planning process. This outlines a range of mitigation and compensation measures that may be offered by developers to offset loss or damage, where developments affecting ancient woodland and veteran trees may receive planning permission. \r\n\r\nIn addition to this, England’s woodland coverage is as high as it has been since the 14th century, totaling a little more than 1.3 million hectares, which equates to 41% of the UK total or 10% of England’s land area. We have a commitment to plant a further 11 million trees before the end of this Parliament. \r\n\r\nWe recognise that this issue is complex and we are continually striving to improve the operation of planning protections for ancient woodlands. The challenges we face today are totally different from the challenges of even 20 years ago, which is why we need to balance woodland interests with our wider competing land use requirements. The Government considers that the existing protection for ancient woodland in the NPPF is strong and is protecting our ancient woodlands and veteran trees. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food \u0026 Rural Affairs ","created_at":"2016-06-17T10:05:57.439Z","updated_at":"2016-06-17T10:07:25.853Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":126548,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/126548.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Test on Request-GP's to listen to girls \u0026 if they have symptoms to do the smear","background":"Jade Goody passed away of cervical cancer and publicised her illness to save others.

It should be noted that a cervical screening test (previously known as a smear test) is a method of detecting abnormal cells on the cervix and is unlikely to be appropriate when a woman has gynaecological issues that are symptomatic of cancer. The guidelines recommend that GPs should consider a suspected cancer pathway referral (for an appointment within 2 weeks) for women if, on examination, the appearance of their cervix is consistent with cervical cancer and do not include the need to conduct a cervical screening test.

In its most severe form, respiratory problems mean children rarely survive beyond two years of age.\r\n\r\nTreatment and support, including exercise and physiotherapy, the provision of assistive equipment and support with nutrition, feeding and breathing is available to help manage the symptoms of SMA and provide the best possible quality of life.\r\n\r\nNusinersen (also known under its developmental names ISIS SMNRx and ISIS 396443), is a medicine being developed by the pharmaceutical company Ionis Pharmaceuticals Incorporated.  It is currently undergoing Phase III clinical trials in patients with SMA.  Patients may access medicines that are still in development by enrolling in clinical trials for that condition.  Details for such studies can be found through the UK Clinical Trials Gateway (www.ukctg.nihr.ac.uk/) by searching for “spinal muscular dystrophy”.   Participation in a clinical trial should always be discussed and coordinated with the patient’s doctor.    \r\n\r\nIn order for the company to supply or sell Nusinersen as a medicine, it would be necessary to obtain a marketing authorisation (or licence) which requires the submission of evidence to regulators to demonstrate that the product is safe, has efficacy in the purpose claimed for it, is prepared to the necessary quality standards and that there is a positive balance of benefits over any risks. The company will be able to submit an application to the relevant medicines regulator for evaluation when the clinical trials are completed.  \r\n\r\nThe EMA has a procedure for the accelerated assessment of new medicines that are considered to represent a major interest from a public health point of view.  It is the company’s decision whether to apply for an accelerated assessment.     \r\n\r\nOutside of clinical trials, the UK early access to medicines scheme (EAMS) aims to facilitate access for UK patients to unlicensed or off-label medicines when those patients have life threatening or seriously debilitating conditions without adequate licensed treatment options. Again, it is for the company to decide whether to apply for an EAMS designation.  Further information about the scheme is available at: www.gov.uk/apply-for-the-early-access-to-medicines-scheme-eams. \r\n\r\nIn certain specific circumstances, doctors may prescribe an unlicensed medicine for an individual patient outside of the clinical trials setting, where they consider that the benefits of treatment outweigh any risks of using the unlicensed medicine. In such situations, a clinician may decide to prescribe on his personal responsibility a licensed medicine outside its authorised indication or an unlicensed medicine to meet the needs of an individual patient. This is reflected in professional guidance.  In such cases, we would expect clinicians to seek informed consent from their patients on the basis that there are risks associated with using an off-label/unlicensed medicine as well as potential therapeutic benefit. Patients should also be informed that the licensing assessment of the medicine for off-label or unlicensed use will not have taken place.  Further information on the supply of unlicensed medicinal products can be found at:  www.gov.uk/government/publications/supply-unlicensed-medicinal-products-specials \r\n\r\nThe Government is actively looking at what we can do to accelerate the pathway for innovative drugs to reach NHS patients, including those with rare diseases like SMA.  The Accelerated Access Review, independently chaired by Sir Hugh Taylor, will make recommendations to Government on speeding up access for NHS patients to innovative and cost-effective new medicines, diagnostics, medical technologies and digital products.

The latter provides for public service pensions to be uprated at the same time and by the same percentage as the increase in the additional pension provided under the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (SERPS), which has been based on the increase in the CPI since April 2011. Prior to this date the RPI was used rather than the CPI. The underlying purpose of this legislation is to maintain the purchasing power of the additional elements of state retirement pensions and public service pensions. \r\n\r\nThe rationale for the change is as follows:\r\n•\tCPI is the headline measure of inflation used by the Bank of England;\r\n•\tCPI takes better account of how behaviour changes in response to price changes; \r\n•\tCPI also more accurately represents the inflation experience of pensioners and benefit recipients – for example, RPI excludes pensioners who receive a significant proportion of their income from the State (up to 20% of retired households); and\r\n•\tCPI is less volatile – for example, RPI was negative in September 2009 whereas CPI continued to rise.\r\n\r\nThe pension is accrued (or activated) on the basis of current prices.  The uprating of pensions does not apply retrospectively.\r\n\r\nIn response to a legal challenge against this decision the High Court and the Court of Appeal both ruled in the Government's favour, finding that CPI is appropriate for benefits and pensions uprating.\r\n\r\nRPI has also historically experienced periods of negative year on year change, as in 2009 when the uprating of pensions in payment was also frozen.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence","created_at":"2016-05-27T14:26:17.605Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T14:28:05.184Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":136595,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/136595.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Maintain the Erasmus scheme despite Britain's exit from the European Union","background":"My degree programme consists of a placement year which is part-funded by the Erasmus scheme.\r\n\r\nHowever, the EU referendum has endangered access to this funding for myself and thousands of others.

The very nature of this amendment means we must take the time to consult others before bringing final proposals on how to implement.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, the UK continues to take a comprehensive approach to the Syria conflict and migration crisis by providing significant aid and assistance; including our resettlement programmes.  On 4 February 2016, the Prime Minister announced that the UK will more than double our total pledge to the Syria crisis from £1.12 billion to over £2.3 billion.  This is our largest ever response to a single humanitarian crisis.  The Syrian Resettlement Scheme has already provided safe haven to more than 1000 vulnerable Syrians – around half of them children - and overall we expect children to make up a significant proportion of the 20,000 resettlement places we are providing to this group.\r\n\r\nAs announced on 21 April, we have worked closely with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to design a resettlement scheme that will protect the most vulnerable children. The new scheme has been designed with the UNHCR to resettle ‘children at risk’ from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.  The Government has committed to resettling several hundred individuals in the first year with a view to resettling up to 3000 individuals over the lifetime of this Parliament, the majority of which will be children, where the UNHCR deem it to be in their best interests. Children who are identified as at risk will be resettled with their family members or carers where appropriate.  There will be a review of the scheme at the two year mark.\r\n\r\nThis unique initiative will be the largest resettlement effort that focuses on children at risk from the MENA region.  The new scheme will be in addition to the Prime Minister’s commitment to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees. It is also in addition to our other existing resettlement schemes. \r\n\r\nIn regards to Europe, we are providing significant assistance to Member States facing particular pressures to ensure that all refugees can have effective access to protection, wherever they are.   The UK is the largest bilateral contributor to the humanitarian response to the crisis in Europe and the Balkans with a total contribution of £65m.  This includes nearly £46 million to provide life-saving aid to migrants and refugees including food, water, hygiene kits and infant packs, and protection for the most vulnerable, as well as support to organisations helping governments build their capacity to manage arrivals in Greece and the Balkans. The efforts of the partners we fund are targeted to reach the most vulnerable - including children.\r\n\r\nIt also includes the £10m Refugee Children Fund the Department for International Development (DFID) has created to support the needs of vulnerable refugee and migrant children specifically in Europe.

The purpose of the Success Regime is to improve and promote health and care services for patients in local health and care systems that are struggling with financial or quality problems, or sometimes both.  Two other health economies are also participating: Mid and South Essex and West, North and East Cumbria.\r\n\r\nThe regime is tailored to local circumstances, building on existing interventions and working with providers, commissioners and other local stakeholders to diagnose underlying issues and develop and implement the solutions to address both short-term performance and long-term strategic issues.\r\n\r\nFollowing an intense diagnostic phase, the North, East and West Devon Success Regime have published a “Case for Change” report, which sets out the underlying challenges facing the area and opportunities to reduce health inequalities, improve access to services and ensure clinical and financial stability. The Success Regime is now starting work locally to respond to the Case for Change. Potential service models for acute and community care are being considered. \r\n\r\nLocal and national leaders working as part of the Success Regime are conscious of the need to ensure that the people of North Devon are able to access high quality, sustainable services.

The geography of the area means that certain key services based in acute hospitals will remain an important feature of healthcare provision across Devon in future, including in the North of the county. However, ear marking particular services could hinder a full process of options development which is necessary to reach the most sustainable proposals.\r\n\r\nNo decisions have yet been made and the input of local communities will remain important throughout the process.

The IPSPC recommended that the Normal Pension Age (NPA) for the new schemes be increased in line with the State Pension Age (SPA) to reflect increased life expectancy, which has grown dramatically in the last few decades. It was also recommended that the link between SPA and NPA should be reviewed regularly with a preference for keeping the two pension ages linked. This would more fairly distribute the benefits between scheme members. An exception was made for the uniformed services where the new NPA was set to age 60, rather than the national age of 65, to reflect the unique characteristics of the work involved. \r\n\r\nFor members of Armed Forces Pension Scheme 2015 (AFPS15) personnel who do not serve until the NPA of 60, an Early Departure Payment (EDP) consisting of a tax-free lump sum and an annual income is provided to personnel; provided they have completed 20 years’ service and reached age 40.  A similar arrangement exists for AFPS 05 members in that they must be aged at least 40 and serve for 18 years. These payments are designed to compensate personnel for the fact that a full military career is not available to the majority of Regular Service personnel, and the corresponding reduction in pension. It should be taken into account that, even prior to the change in NPA, only 2% of Service personnel served through to age 55. For AFPS75 members they are eligible to receive an immediate pension, subject to meeting the pension scheme’s criteria but are not eligible to receive EDP payments. \r\n\r\nService personnel who transferred across to the new Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS 15) had the value of the pension benefits earned up to the introduction of the new scheme protected. These benefits remain payable at the time they were expected to be paid in accordance with the legacy pension scheme rules and linked to the final pensionable salary at the point of leaving the Services. For those who transferred to the new pension scheme, the qualification period for the new EDP also includes time spent in a legacy scheme.  For those members who were within 10 years of their normal pension age as at 1 Apr 2012 they will remain in their existing schemes and be bound by those terms and conditions.   \r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that pensions can be taken from age 55 under AFPS 15, but these are actuarially reduced to reflect the fact that the pension will be paid over a longer period.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence","created_at":"2016-05-25T10:36:54.733Z","updated_at":"2016-05-25T10:36:54.733Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":123631,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/123631.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Amend the Dangerous Dogs Act to allow for fair, uniform return of seized dogs.","background":"Hundreds of dogs are seized every year by authorities as prohibited dogs, many having posed no danger.

","details":"The Government keeps the firearms licensing system under review to safeguard against abuse by criminals and to preserve public safety. Following Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC’s) inspection of firearms licensing , and their recommendation to put police guidelines on a statutory footing, clause 107 of the Policing and Crime Bill introduces a power for the Home Secretary to issue the police with statutory guidance on firearms. \r\n\r\nThis will allow existing safeguards around firearms ownership, for example background checks, medical suitability checks, and criteria around applicants with a history of domestic violence, to be enshrined in statutory guidelines. Other aspects of the existing Home Office guide will remain on a non-statutory footing. \r\n\r\nThe new statutory guidance will ensure that the highest standards of public safety are maintained. Responsible gun owners who pose no risk will continue to be granted firearms certificates by the police, as they are now. \r\n\r\nThe police must have regard to the guidance issued by the Home Secretary. Currently, because Home Office guidance is non-statutory, the police are not obliged to follow it. HMIC’s report on firearms licensing found that existing guidance was frequently not followed, resulting in an inconsistent approach between forces.\r\n\r\nThe Home Secretary will consult widely on the first edition of the new statutory guidance and will consider the views of shooting organisations as well as those of the police. The Government always aims to seek views from organisations likely to be affected by policy changes, and this is not a matter for legislation. The police must be able to implement the new guidance and are therefore listed as a statutory consultee.\r\n\r\nThe clause will be subject to Parliamentary scrutiny during the passage of the Bill.\r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2016-06-07T14:08:00.354Z","updated_at":"2016-06-07T14:08:00.354Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":121612,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/121612.json"},"attributes":{"action":"House of Commons to have Free Vote on Imposition of Junior Doctors Contract","background":"The government have chosen to impose a contract on Junior Doctors without evidence that such a contract would improve weekend care without deterioration of weekday care.

It is supported by the British Medical Association, which will ballot junior doctors in June.","details":"Parliament has been updated regularly on all developments relating to the junior doctors’ contract, including through a number of statements, debates and questions. \r\n\r\nOn 19 May, Parliament was informed that, after 10 days of intensive discussion under the auspices of ACAS, an historic agreement has been reached between the government, NHS Employers (acting on behalf of the employers of junior doctors) and the British Medical Association (BMA).  This agreement will facilitate the biggest changes to the junior doctors’ contract since 1999 and will modernise the contract making it better for both doctors and patients. \r\n\r\nThe government has always been determined that the NHS should offer the safest, highest quality of care possible,  which means a consistent standard of care for patients admitted across all seven days of the week. Changes under the new contract include:\r\n\r\n•\testablishing the principle that any doctor who works less than an average of one weekend day a month (Saturday or Sunday) should receive no additional premium pay, compensated by an increase in basic pay of between 10 and 11%;\r\n•\treducing the marginal cost of employing additional doctors at the weekend by about a third;\r\n•\tsupporting all hospitals to meet the four clinical standards most important for reducing mortality rates for weekend admissions by establishing a new role for experienced junior doctors as ‘senior-clinical decision makers’ able to make expert assessments of vulnerable patients who may be admitted or staying in hospitals over weekends; and \r\n•\tremoving the disincentive to roster sufficient numbers of doctors at weekends by replacing an inflexible banding system with a fairer system that values weekend work by paying actual unsocial hours worked with more pay to those who work the most.\r\n\r\nThe government also recognises that safer care for patients is more likely to be provided by well-motivated doctors who have sufficient rest between shifts and work in a family-friendly system. The new contract and ACAS agreement will improve the wellbeing of the junior doctor workforce by:\r\n\r\n•\treducing the maximum hours a doctor can be asked to work in any one week from 91 to 72;\r\n•\treducing the number of nights a doctor can be asked to work consecutively to four and reducing the number of long days a doctor can be asked to work to five;\r\n•\tintroducing a new post, a Guardian of Safe Working, in every Trust to guard against doctors being asked to work excessive hours;\r\n•\tintroducing a new catch up programme for doctors who take maternity leave or time off for other caring responsibilities; \r\n•\testablishing a review by  Health Education England to consider how best to allow couples to apply to train in the same area and to offer training placements for those with caring responsibilities close to their home;\r\n•\tgiving pay protection to doctors who switch specialties because of caring responsibilities; and\r\n•\testablishing a review to inform a new requirement on Trusts to consider caring and other family responsibilities when designing rotas. \r\n\r\nTaken together these changes show both the government’s commitment to safe care for patients and the value it attaches to the role of junior doctors. This agreement will allow the government to deliver a seven day NHS, improve patient safety, and support much-needed productivity improvements, as well as strengthening the morale and quality of life of junior doctors with a modern contract fit for a modern health service.\r\n\r\nNHS Employers will publish a revised contract at the end of May and the Department of Health will publish an equalities analysis of the new terms. \r\n\r\nThe new contract and the agreement has the support of the Chair of the Junior Doctors’ Committee of the BMA, and will be put to a ballot of the BMA membership in June.  \r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2016-05-26T09:14:40.149Z","updated_at":"2016-05-26T09:14:40.149Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":132671,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/132671.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Ensure that MPs are factually accurate \u0026 accountable in public campaigns","background":"Throughout recent campaigns, MPs from all sides have been accused of scaremongering and falsely purveying facts.
