I am hoping to get this changed so other women like myself can get the answers and save the heartbreak please help.","state":"open","signature_count":24,"created_at":"2017-11-09T09:18:02.412Z","updated_at":"2017-11-19T16:01:57.646Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-11-16T12:18:11.919Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-11-09T16:01:19.788Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Shannon brooke reed","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":203057,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/203057.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Stop kids under 16 buying all energy drinks","background":"Energy drinks are full of caffeine - no wonder kids have bad attitudes and are hyped all the time.
