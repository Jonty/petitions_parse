A state that ignores International Human Rights Agreements, that they even co-signed. A state where the detention of the opposition is natural. In 2015, Venezuela exported $286 million worth of goods to the UK - most of which was mineral products (99.2%). The UK exports to Venezuela in 2015 amounted a total of $318 million. Although Venezuela may be an attractive source of investment for UK firms, I urge them to stop. Simply because the trade revenue enables Pres Maduro's suppression of basic human rights.
