The best way of avoiding it is for MPs to approve the deal. However, in the event of a no deal, the EU (Withdrawal) Act will be in place to ensure legal continuity.","details":"The EU (Withdrawal) Act is a vital piece of legislation ensuring that the UK has a functioning statute book once we have left the EU. It does not dictate the date and time at which we leave the EU. The default date and time of our departure was set when the UK notified the EU of its intention to withdraw under Article 50, which is a matter of international law. \r\n\r\nIf we were to repeal the EU (Withdrawal) Act ahead of our exit from the EU, it would not prevent the UK from leaving the EU, but instead lead to a huge amount of legal uncertainty. The European Communities Act would not be repealed despite the UK having left the EU, and many of the EU laws that businesses and citizens currently live under would not be transferred into our domestic law.\r\n\r\nThe decision to notify our withdrawal under Article 50 was authorised by Parliament through the EU (Notification of Withdrawal) Act, which was approved at Commons Second Reading with a large majority in favour in February 2017. That was, in turn, a response to the 2016 referendum result, in which the British people voted to leave the EU in one of the biggest democratic exercises in the country’s history. \r\n\r\nThe Government’s top priority remains securing Parliamentary approval for the deal we have negotiated with our European partners. That is the best way to deliver on the democratic choice of the British people and the best way to avoid no deal. In this settlement, the UK and the EU have agreed the terms for the UK’s smooth and orderly exit from the EU in the form of the Withdrawal Agreement, and a detailed political declaration on the terms of our future relationship. The Withdrawal Agreement offers a time-limited implementation period that provides a bridge to the future relationship, allowing businesses to continue trading as now until the end of 2020. \r\n\r\nUntil MPs have voted to approve the deal and the Withdrawal Agreement, we will do the responsible thing and prepare for every eventuality, including no deal. The Government has been preparing extensively for a no deal scenario for over two years to ensure that the country operates as smoothly as possible from the day we leave.\r\n\r\nWe have put in place numerous measures to mitigate the potential impact of no deal. For example, we have ensured that critical legislation is in place to ensure legal continuity, agreed key international agreements such as the Nuclear Cooperation deal with the US, Australia and Canada, and we are recruiting hundreds of Border Force officers to keep our border secure.\r\n\r\nWe have also taken steps to communicate to the public how Brexit will affect them and the practical steps that they can take to prepare for it. For example, in the summer of 2018 we published 106 specific technical notices to help businesses, citizens and consumers prepare for March 2019 in the event of a no-deal scenario. More recently, we launched a public information campaign at gov.uk/euexit to give UK citizens, businesses, EU citizens living in the UK and UK nationals living in the EU the latest advice and information on any aspect of Brexit. The Government will continue to provide advice to businesses and citizens on preparing for Exit.\r\n\r\nWith critical legislation in place including the EU Withdrawal Act, we are confident of the UK’s long term prospects in all scenarios.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Exiting the European Union","created_at":"2019-01-15T16:33:26.291Z","updated_at":"2019-01-15T16:33:26.291Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":226975,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/226975.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Ban face coverings in public","background":"People can not be identified when the face is covered and people are becoming more offended and some even scared, with different gangs appearing all over and violent crimes are being committed.","additional_details":"","state":"open","signature_count":13693,"created_at":"2018-08-09T22:44:28.373Z","updated_at":"2019-01-23T20:40:36.593Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-08-17T12:33:33.683Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-08-10T12:35:38.456Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2018-12-11T18:45:17.174Z","government_response_at":"2018-12-21T08:24:47.871Z","debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Donna Hopkinson","rejection":null,"government_response":{"responded_on":"2018-12-21","summary":"The Government does not support a general ban on the wearing of face coverings in public.

","details":"The UK must have safe, secure and affordable supplies of energy with carbon emissions levels that are consistent with the carbon budgets defined in our Climate Change Act and our international obligations. We believe that gas has a key part to play in meeting these objectives both currently and in the future. Every scenario proposed by the Committee on Climate Change to meet our legally binding carbon reduction commitments includes demand for natural gas.\r\n\r\nIn part as a result of the UK’s diverse range of energy sources, which include natural gas, we have had competitively-priced energy since 1990 whilst reducing carbon emissions across the economy by 49% – a leading performance among developed nations. Gas still meets over a third of our energy demand and can have a long-term role – particularly alongside the development of carbon capture, utilisation and storage –  which is compatible with our climate change targets as we transition to a low carbon economy.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite the welcome improvements in efficiency and innovation from companies operating in the North Sea, the ongoing decline in our offshore gas production has meant that the UK has gone from being a net exporter of gas in 2003 to importing over half (53%) of gas supplies in 2017 and estimates suggest we could be importing 72% of our gas by 2030. Our current import mix, via pipelines from Norway and Continental Europe and LNG terminals that can source gas from around the world, provides us with stable and secure supplies. However, we believe that it is right to utilise our domestic gas and explore further the potential for onshore gas production from shale rock formations in the UK, where it is economically efficient, and where environment impacts are robustly regulated.\r\n\r\nIn the UK, we have been regulating for gas and oil drilling, both onshore and offshore, for decades and have world leading regulations in place to ensure on-site safety, prevent water contamination, and mitigate seismic activity and air pollution.\r\n\r\nOur tough regulatory system provides a comprehensive regime for exploratory activities.  Our position draws on independent reviews by the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering (2012), and Public Health England (2014).  These reports have considered a wide range of evidence and looked at the UK regulatory system, and hydraulic fracturing in the UK context.  The Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering concluded: “the risks can be managed effectively in the UK, if operational best practices are implemented and enforced through regulation.” \r\n\r\nMoreover, the Infrastructure Act (2015) introduced a range of additional safeguards if an operator wishes to carry out hydraulic fracturing, to provide the public with confidence that this industry is being taken forward safely.  These include environmental and planning permits, groundwater monitoring, and the exclusion of protected areas.\r\n\r\nThe UK has an excellent record of protecting our environment, and the Government has been clear that any resources will only be developed in a manner that is safe and environmentally sound.\r\n\r\nThe Government published a Written Ministerial Statement on shale on 17 May 2018, which can be found here: https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2018-05-17/HCWS690/\r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-21T15:32:44.434Z","updated_at":"2018-11-21T15:33:27.445Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":230140,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/230140.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Raise the Rate: increase the national funding rate for sixth form students","background":"Sixth form funding was subject to deep cuts after 2010 and the national funding rate for 16 and 17 year olds has remained frozen at £4,000 per student, per year since 2013/14.

We know what a vital role the sector is playing in making sure people have the skills they need.\r\n\r\nHowever, as with other areas of Departmental spending, 16-19 education funding from 2020 onwards will be considered as part of the next Spending Review.  \r\n\r\nWe are planning to invest nearly £7 billion this academic year to make sure there is a place in education or training, including for apprenticeships, for every 16 to 19 year old.  We have also protected the base rate of funding for all 16 to 19 year old students until 2020 and our commitment to the sector has contributed to the current record high proportion of 16 and 17 year olds who are participating in education or apprenticeships.\r\n\r\nWe are currently delivering a major programme of skills reform and are transforming technical education through the introduction of new T Levels from 2020.  To support the delivery of these new qualifications we will be investing an additional £500m funding per year once the programme is fully rolled out.  We understand that not all providers will be delivering T Levels, however, this does represent a significant investment in our young people and in the 16 to 19 system.\r\n\r\nWhilst we are currently focusing on the introduction of T Levels and reforms to the apprenticeship system, this does not eclipse the crucial importance of the academic curriculum, or the key role FE and sixth form schools and colleges play in delivering this.

Additional funding of over £500 million is available to provide extra support to disadvantaged students and students on large study programmes.

Entitlement to State Pension is based on rules at the time of the claim.","details":"The equalisation of State Pension age was introduced against a background of a wide consultation on the policy.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, after 2 years of debate in Parliament and following public consultation, the Government brought in a law to equalise men and women’s State Pension age (SPa). This increased the earliest age when a woman could claim State Pension (SP) from 60 to 65. The Government planned for the original change to take place over 10 years between 2010 and 2020.\r\n\r\nThe Government has gone to significant lengths to communicate SPa changes. Over the last 18 years the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has provided over 25 million personalised State Pension estimates to people who requested them. It has encouraged people to request these as part of their long-term financial planning – after all, retirement is a life changing financial decision and people are expected to plan for this.\r\n\r\nThe equalisation of men and women’s SPa was often reported in the media and debated at length in Parliament. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) produced communications materials relating to increases in State Pension age (SPa) for both men and women, and carried out a pension’s education campaign between 2001 and 2004. This included information on the future equalisation of SPa. Later DWP sent individual letters to those affected. \r\n\r\nBecause of increases in life expectancy the Government needed to make further changes to State Pension age subsequent to Pensions Act 1995 to ensure that the state pension was affordable and sustainable over the long term. In 2007 it introduced a law to increase SPa for everyone to 66 by 2026, to 67 by 2036 and to 68 by 2046. In 2011 it introduced another law to equalise men and women’s SPa more quickly. The 2011 law also brought forward the increase in everyone’s SPa from 65 to 66 by five and a half years.\r\n\r\nThe terms of entitlement to State Pension has to be seen in the context that the State Pension is a Social Security benefit funded through National Insurance contributions.\r\n\r\nThe payment of the State Pension benefit is dependent on reaching the age of eligibility which can be amended through primary legislation. There is no legal contract for the pension between the state and an individual. The National Insurance scheme operates on a 'pay-as-you-go' basis. This means that today’s contributors are paying for today’s social security entitlements and pensions, and those paying contributions previously were paying for the pensioners of that time. In other words, contributors do not accumulate an individual pension fund of actual monies they have paid, which is personal to them. Instead, payment of contributions entitles them or, in certain circumstances, their spouses to a range of social security entitlements which are available on the basis of the rules applicable at the time of the claim.\r\n\r\nWith Government facing increasing financial pressures, it is simply not justified to reverse the policy on State Pension age equalisation. As an example, women who reached State Pension age in 2016 are estimated to receive more State Pension on average over their lifetime than women ever have before.\r\n\r\nWe will be making no further changes to the law on this issue. Doing so would mean working-age people, especially younger people, bearing a greater financial burden to support the rising costs of the pensions system. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions","created_at":"2018-12-20T22:32:55.398Z","updated_at":"2018-12-20T22:32:55.398Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":231761,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/231761.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make sure mothers get National Insurance credits towards their state pension","background":"Allow backdated claims for mothers who have not claimed child benefit since the high income child benefit charge began in 2013 and who would otherwise miss out on NI credits towards their pension, and contact them directly to encourage them to make a claim.","additional_details":"Since the introduction of the High Income Child Benefit Charge in 2013, thousands of mothers have decided not to claim child benefit, losing out on vital NI credits towards their pension.

However, extensive arrangements are already in place to ensure people can access affordable prescriptions.","details":"While most NHS treatment is free at the point of use, there are some costs that people might need to pay. For example, in England many working age adults pay prescription charges, although some prescribed items are always free including contraceptives and medication for hospital inpatients. Prescription charges are a valuable income source for the NHS, contributing £575.9 million in revenue for the financial year 2017/18. This funding is particularly important given the increasing demands on the NHS.\r\n\r\nSome people are eligible for help with their health costs. This includes: NHS prescription charges, NHS dental treatment charges, the cost of travelling to receive NHS treatment, NHS wigs and fabric supports, and the cost of sight tests, glasses and contact lenses. Help with health costs in England depends on if the individual is in receipt of certain qualifying benefits, whether they are pregnant or have recently had a baby, whether they are aged 60 or over, under 16 years old, or are under 19 years old but are in qualifying full-time education, get a war pension or have a qualifying medical condition. Together these existing exemptions mean that around 90% of NHS prescriptions are currently dispensed free of charge.\r\n\r\nSickle cell anaemia is not currently listed as a qualifying medical condition for the purposes of help with health costs. Professor Sir Ian Gilmore undertook a review into extending exemptions to all those with long-term conditions, which was published in 2010. At this time, a decision was taken that no changes would be made in light of the financial challenges facing the country. This remains the position and the Government has no current plans to amend the list of medical conditions that provide exemption from NHS prescription charges.\r\n\r\nPeople with sickle cell anaemia may be eligible for one of the non-medical prescription charge exemptions and it is recommended they check. For convenience an eligibility checker tool is available on the NHS Business Services Authority’s (BSA) website at: \r\nhttps://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/check-for-help-paying-nhs-costs/start. \r\n\r\nThis tool has been widely publicised by the nationwide ‘check before you tick’ campaign, launched by NHS England and the NHS Business Services Authority (NHS BSA) to help people understand their eligibility for free NHS prescriptions.\r\n\r\nIn addition, people on low incomes can apply for help with their health costs through the NHS Low Income Scheme. The Scheme provides income related help to people who are not automatically exempt from NHS prescription charges but who may be entitled to full or partial help if they have a low income and savings below a defined limit. Further information, including on how to apply, is available on the NHS BSA’s website at: \r\nwww.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/nhs-low-income-scheme. \r\n\r\nThose people who are not eligible for help with health costs, yet have a high-level or long-term need for prescription medication, may be able to save money by purchasing a prescription prepayment certificate (PPC). These allow people to obtain as many prescriptions as they need for a set cost: £29.10 for a 3-month PPC and £104 for a 12-month PPC. In addition, people can spread the cost of a 12-month PPC by paying through 10 monthly direct debit payments.

This is why we established the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF). The CDF works to ensure that patients in England have better access to effective cancer drugs not routinely funded by the NHS.\r\n \r\nSince October 2010, the Cancer Drugs Fund has enabled over 120,000 approvals for treating people in England with life-extending cancer drugs that would not otherwise have been available to them.  Since the introduction of the Fund we have spent more than £1.9 billion helping people with cancer get the treatments they need.  New arrangements for the appraisal and funding of cancer drugs in England which came into effect from July 2016 are also helping to provide faster access to the most promising new cancer drugs and ensure better value for taxpayers and the NHS.\r\n \r\nNICE is the independent body that provides guidance on the prevention and treatment of ill health and the promotion of good health and social care. NICE produces a range of guidance products, including technology appraisals, clinical guidelines and quality standards. Decisions on which medicines should be routinely available on the NHS are very difficult to make and NICE only reaches its final decisions on the use of a technology after a careful and thorough consideration of the evidence and following extensive consultation with stakeholders.  \r\n\r\nNICE published technology appraisal guidance on pembrolizumab for untreated PD-L1-positive metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (TA447) on 28 June 2017.  NICE recommended pembrolizumab as an option for certain people with untreated PD-L1-positive metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer, within the Cancer Drugs Fund (CDF).  It was initially recommended for use within the CDF because there were clinical uncertainties that needed to be resolved using further data from an ongoing clinical trial.  When the guidance was reviewed in the light of the new data from the trial, NICE was able to confirm its effectiveness and recommend it for routine commissioning. On 28 July 2018 NICE therefore published updated recommendations which are available at Pembrolizumab for untreated PD-L1-positive metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (TA531)\r\nhttps://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ta531/ \r\n\r\nThe recommendation to stop treatment at 2 years, in both the original and updated guidance, was based on the best available clinical evidence, especially one particular trial (KEYNOTE 024). This trial was designed to stop treatment at 2 years, on the expectation that patients would not need to continue treatment to achieve the long-term benefit.
