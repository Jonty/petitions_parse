The defence call these victims liars, sluts and retraumatise them all over again. Something needs to change as damaging and destroying a victim of such crime where there is enough evidence to suggest the suspect is guilty to get them off a charge is not the way forward.","state":"open","signature_count":6,"created_at":"2018-12-28T21:25:12.695Z","updated_at":"2019-01-16T17:51:36.097Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2019-01-16T17:51:36.094Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-12-28T21:48:45.111Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Charlotte Rhea","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":234733,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/234733.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Give under 18's free self-test STI kits","background":"Self-test kits for STIs are also available online and on the high street.
