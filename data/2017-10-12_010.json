Student are regularly left with a short fall and having to money to help pay for courses or living costs. There is no consistency with postgraduate fees like there is with undergraduate fees.","additional_details":"Postgraduate courses can vary from £6000 up to £25000, meaning that students may have to find and extra £15000 to pay for the course after and if they receive the full £10000 loan from the government, that doesn’t include living costs! This is clearly putting a number of students at a disadvantage and preventing them from studying postgraduate courses as many will not able to find this amount of money. We should be encouraging education, therefore a cap on fees would be the best option.","state":"open","signature_count":6,"created_at":"2017-10-02T06:53:19.533Z","updated_at":"2017-10-10T16:47:31.086Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-10-10T16:47:31.083Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-10-08T14:28:25.211Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Andrew Wilson","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":200233,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200233.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Scrap the OISC and extend the remit of the SRA to Immigration Advisers","background":"The Office of Immigration Services Commissioner (OISC) is sponsored by the Home Office and regulates immigration advisers, professionals that do an important job and many are more specialised than solicitors.
