Serving five years of ten in prison is not enough, instead of shutting prisons, there should be enough to allow violent offenders to serve a whole term sentence. Criminals these days know how to play the parole board knowing they may be able to go home halfway through their sentence even though they have taken a life. This situation does not deter violent people from carrying or arming themselves with a knife and ultimately killing someone.","state":"open","signature_count":24,"created_at":"2018-11-06T12:43:45.457Z","updated_at":"2018-12-16T23:28:41.770Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-11-21T17:23:52.512Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-11-12T07:25:05.730Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Gill Veysey","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":231371,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/231371.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Protect victims of domestic violence who come from the European Union","background":"To date, UK immigration legislation offers protection for victims of domestic violence who hold a non-European passport.
