Current NHS treatments for the illness are based on the controversial PACE trial, and have been found ineffective or even harmful. Good quality research into the root cause of the illness is needed. The current annual budget for biomedical research works at roughly £1 per patient per year. We want the budget for research to be dramatically increased. We also ask for the formation of a work group focussing on the issues surrounding this disease.","state":"open","signature_count":58,"created_at":"2016-09-18T23:12:45.421Z","updated_at":"2017-02-18T11:04:54.973Z","open_at":"2016-09-21T15:41:28.476Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2016-09-21T10:55:33.841Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"creator_name":"Cassie Rogers","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":166199,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/166199.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make it illegal for parents not to vaccinate a child","background":"Not vaccinating your children makes two things more likely\r\n- Your child will get sick\r\n- Your child will spread that illness to other unprotected children, some of whom may be too young to have received the necessary vaccination.\r\nTherefore, not getting your child vaccinated is grossly negligent.","additional_details":"Herd immunity is the primary reason for mass immunisation - in layman's terms, it means that the more people are immunised against a given disease, the less that disease will be able to spread, and more people (especially children too young to receive that specific vaccination) will be safe from it.
