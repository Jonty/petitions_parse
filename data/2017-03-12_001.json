It protects both privacy and security and underwent unprecedented scrutiny before becoming law.","details":"The Government is clear that, at a time of heightened security threat, it is essential our law enforcement, security and intelligence services have the powers they need to keep people safe.\r\n\r\nThe Investigatory Powers Act transforms the law relating to the use and oversight of Investigatory powers. It strengthens safeguards and introduces world-leading oversight arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe Act does three key things. First, it brings together powers already available to law enforcement and the security and intelligence agencies to obtain communications and data about communications. It makes these powers – and the safeguards that apply to them – clear and understandable.\r\n\r\nSecond, it radically overhauls the way these powers are authorised and overseen. It introduces a ‘double-lock’ for the most intrusive powers, including interception and all of the bulk capabilities, so warrants require the approval of a Judicial Commissioner. And it creates a powerful new Investigatory Powers Commissioner to oversee how these powers are used.\r\n\r\nThird, it ensures powers are fit for the digital age. The Act makes a single new provision for the retention of internet connection records in order for law enforcement to identify the communications service to which a device has connected. This will restore capabilities that have been lost as a result of changes in the way people communicate.\r\n\r\nPublic scrutiny\r\n\r\nThe Bill was subject to unprecedented scrutiny prior to and during its passage.\r\nThe Bill responded to three independent reports: by David Anderson QC, the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation; by the Royal United Services Institute’s Independent Surveillance Review Panel; and by the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament. All three of those authoritative independent reports agreed a new law was needed.\r\n \r\nThe Government responded to the recommendations of those reports in the form of a draft Bill, published in November 2015. That draft Bill was submitted for pre-legislative scrutiny by a Joint Committee of both Houses of Parliament. The Intelligence and Security Committee and the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee conducted parallel scrutiny. Between them, those Committees received over 1,500 pages of written submissions and heard oral evidence from the Government, industry, civil liberties groups and many others. The recommendations made by those Committees informed changes to the Bill and the publication of further supporting material.\r\n\r\nA revised Bill was introduced in the House of Commons on 1 March, and completed its passage on 16 November, meeting the timetable for legislation set by Parliament during the passage of the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014. Over 1,700 amendments to the Bill were tabled and debated during this time. \r\n\r\nThe Government has adopted an open and consultative approach throughout the passage of this legislation, tabling or accepting a significant number of amendments in both Houses of Parliament in order to improve transparency and strengthen privacy protections. These included enhanced protections for trade unions and journalistic and legally privileged material, and the introduction of a threshold to ensure internet connection records cannot be used to investigate minor crimes. \r\n\r\nPrivacy and Oversight\r\n\r\nThe Government has placed privacy at the heart of the Investigatory Powers Act. The Act makes clear the extent to which investigatory powers may be used and the strict safeguards that apply in order to maintain privacy. \r\n\r\nA new overarching ‘privacy clause’ was added to make absolutely clear that the protection of privacy is at the heart of this legislation. This privacy clause ensures that in each and every case a public authority must consider whether less intrusive means could be used, and must have regard to human rights and the particular sensitivity of certain information. The powers can only be exercised when it is necessary and proportionate to do so, and the Act includes tough sanctions – including the creation of new criminal offences – for those misusing the powers.\r\nThe safeguards in this Act reflect the UK’s international reputation for protecting human rights. The unprecedented transparency and the new safeguards – including the ‘double lock’ for the most sensitive powers – set an international benchmark for how the law can protect both privacy and security.\r\n \r\nHome Office","created_at":"2016-11-29T12:00:09.557Z","updated_at":"2016-11-29T12:00:09.557Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":null,"transcript_url":"","video_url":"","overview":"The Petitions Committee has decided not to schedule a debate on this petition.

","details":"The Government is aware that the cost of motor insurance can be high for new and inexperienced drivers. We have taken forward a programme of measures to strengthen the way that people learn to drive and are tested.  We have engaged insurers in this process, so that they can have confidence that additional measures will make a real difference that can be rewarded with lower premiums.  \r\n\r\nMotor insurance premiums can vary according to the risks associated with different types of driver, vehicle and other factors such as age and driving experience.   Motor insurance is a very competitive market and shopping around for the best possible option before making any decisions is likely to benefit customers.  The British Insurance Brokers Association (BIBA) run a not for profit ‘find a broker’ service where there are many broker products for young drivers. Further information can be found on their website: www.biba.org.uk. New rules coming into force next year will require motor insurers to disclose last year’s premium at renewal and prompt customers to shop around for the best deal.\r\n\r\nSome insurers have introduced the use of telematics or in-car black boxes to allow better risk-based pricing for new drivers. It means insurers now have a real time data feed, which allows them to see an individual’s driving behaviour, which had not previously been possible in the past. There is some evidence that suggests new drivers could see their annual premiums fall by 20% or more if they show good driving behaviour with a black box installed in their cars. \r\n\r\nThe Government recently announced reforms aimed at tackling the continuing high number and costly whiplash injury claims that were having a negative impact on the price of motor insurance premiums.  These reforms will end the cycle in which motorists pay higher insurance premiums due to minor, exaggerated and fraudulent whiplash claims by others.   The government fully expects insurers to pass on the savings from these reforms to consumers through lower premiums and leading insurers have already committed to do this. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport","created_at":"2016-12-13T09:14:32.035Z","updated_at":"2016-12-13T09:14:32.035Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":182953,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/182953.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Change the University fees from £9250 back to the £3000 fee for the UK.","background":"University fees are rising more and more. £9000 for university fees is too high and the stress of being in dept is what puts individuals off applying for degrees.Now that grants have been removed it makes it difficult for family's who need financial support but can't get that anymore.","additional_details":"","state":"open","signature_count":159904,"created_at":"2017-02-04T21:06:57.271Z","updated_at":"2017-03-11T23:37:02.836Z","open_at":"2017-02-09T13:26:42.171Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":"2017-03-01T14:06:57.952Z","scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":"2017-02-13T13:06:58.589Z","rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-02-05T09:36:09.585Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2017-02-11T21:17:45.559Z","creator_name":"Zahra Walji","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"Anyone with the ability to benefit from higher education should have the opportunity to do so.  All eligible students can apply for an upfront loan to meet the full cost of tuition fees.","details":"Anyone with the ability to benefit from Higher Education should have the opportunity to do so, irrespective of their background.  That is why all eligible students can apply for an upfront tuition fee loan to meet the full cost of their tuition fees, as well as loans for living costs. \r\n\r\nBy replacing maintenance grants with loans we have been able to increase the funding for living costs that the most disadvantaged students receive by over 10% in the current academic year with a further 2.8% increase for 2017/18.\r\n\r\nUniversities, too, are spending even more to help those from disadvantaged backgrounds access higher education. In 2017/18, institutions are expected to spend £833.5 million on measures to improve the access and success of disadvantaged students. This is more than double what was spent in 2009/10.\r\n\r\nOur repayments system is based on income and not the amount borrowed. Graduates with post-2012 undergraduate loans pay back only when they are earning more than £21,000, and then only 9% of earnings above that threshold. After 30 years any outstanding debt will be written off with no detriment to the borrower. This is entirely different to a commercial loan.\r\n\r\nRecent evidence indicates that recent reforms to higher education have not deterred students from disadvantaged backgrounds from going to university. The steps we have taken to ensure higher education remains sustainably financed has enabled us to lift student number controls, so that more people have the opportunity to secure a university place. The proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds entering higher education increased from 13.6% in 2009 to 19.5% in 2016 and the application rate for disadvantaged English 18 year olds in 2017 has increased to a record high at the January 15th application deadline. \r\n\r\nLowering tuition fees would carry a number of possible consequences, including a cut to universities and additional demands on public spending, which would be met through higher taxation, including on those who have not themselves benefited from University.  This could also mean the re-imposition of student number controls, leading to fewer university places being available to students.\r\n\r\nReinstating the system of maintenance grants would reduce the upfront support available for students from some of the most disadvantaged backgrounds, while costing the taxpayer over £2.5bn per year.\r\n\r\nThe Government’s approach has struck the right balance between delivering a sustainable system and ensuring higher education remains open and accessible. This has been recognised by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which said we are “one of the few countries to have figured out a sustainable approach to student finance”.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education","created_at":"2017-03-01T14:06:57.950Z","updated_at":"2017-03-01T14:06:57.950Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":168663,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/168663.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Ban the sale of fireworks to the public and only approve organised displays.","background":"Every year 1000's of people are hurt, burnt, maimed and even lose their lives through accidents involving fireworks.\r\nEvery year people are terrorised by the misuse of fireworks.\r\nEvery year animals are hurt and traumatised by fireworks.\r\nBan them please.","additional_details":"","state":"open","signature_count":158466,"created_at":"2016-10-06T14:50:30.633Z","updated_at":"2017-03-11T23:59:46.375Z","open_at":"2016-10-10T15:10:40.242Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":"2016-11-14T11:25:55.090Z","scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":"2016-11-06T17:56:26.632Z","rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":"2016-11-17T16:39:53.052Z","moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2016-10-06T15:09:03.033Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2016-10-29T07:22:04.779Z","creator_name":"Mike Old","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"Government acknowledges genuine concerns about the use and, the misuse, of fireworks.

Indeed, the majority of the public who use fireworks do so in a safe and considerate way; it is only an anti-social minority that uses them dangerously and inconsiderately. \r\n\r\nWhile members of the public can hold private firework displays at any time of the year, they are subject to strict curfews which prevent fireworks being used after 11pm, except on a limited number of specific nights of the year around the traditional celebrations of 5th November, New Year, Chinese New Year and Diwali when they can be used up to midnight (5th November) or 1am (New Year, Chinese New Year and Diwali). \r\n\r\nRetailers are restricted to selling fireworks for limited periods around these four traditional occasions, unless they have a valid licence specifically allowing all year round sales.\r\n\r\nThere is maximum noise level of 120 decibels on fireworks sold to the public, and local authorities have powers to deal with excessive firework noise.  There is also a prohibition on setting off fireworks in a public place, enforceable by the police with tough sanctions for non-compliance.\r\n\r\nThere is government-sponsored advice and guidance to support the responsible and considerate use of fireworks on the Safer Fireworks website.  \r\n\r\nWhile any firework-related injury is a cause for concern, the number of injuries are significantly lower than suggested.  Furthermore, the latest official statistics, demonstrate that there is a downward trend in hospital admissions in England (arising from the discharge of fireworks) with 28% decrease between 2010 and 2014/15, when there were 114 admissions.\r\n\r\nThe government will continue to focus on reducing accidents and nuisance by encouraging industry, retailers and others to promote responsible use through guidance and public education.  We urge those using fireworks to be considerate to their neighbours and give sufficient notice of firework use, particularly where they are proposing to let off fireworks in the vicinity of animals, especially livestock, where they should notify owners of livestock nearby of their plans.\r\n\r\nThe government considers these controls effectively manage and reduce the level of risk posed by the public use of fireworks, and that to bring in further restrictions would be detrimental to an important British tradition reflecting our history and multi-culturalism.

It employs 3 million people and the sector generated £90 billion of Gross Value Added in 2014, 5.6% of the UK economy and 4% higher than in 2013.\r\n\r\nThe Government also believes that all workers, including those in retail, should have access to employment rights and protections.  The Government’s website, GOV.UK, provides detailed and accessible advice on all aspects of employment, including what to do in case of a dispute.\r\n\r\nRetail opening hours\r\n\r\nThere are no controls on shops’ opening hours on Boxing Day, unless it falls on a Sunday. The Sunday Trading Act 1994 limits the opening hours of large stores in England and Wales (i.e. those with a trading area over 280 square metres / 3,000 square feet) to 6 continuous hours (between 10am and 6pm) on a Sunday and not at all on Easter Sunday. The Christmas Day Trading Act 2004 prohibits large shops from opening on Christmas Day whatever day of the week it falls. Similar legislation applies in Northern Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of the internet has changed consumers’ shopping habits radically and many have got used to the freedom to buy what they need at any time that suits them. Online businesses and smaller retailers already have the flexibility to respond to this demand. Billions of pounds are spent by millions of shoppers on Boxing Day and it is also a busy day for internet sales. The Government believes that all businesses should be allowed flexibility to meet their customers’ needs and offer consumers choice about when and how they want to shop. This will help drive competition, productivity and the local economy, as well as helping create jobs.\r\n\r\nIn this internet age, the Government aims to support local high streets to remain at the heart of our communities by being vibrant and viable places where people live, shop, use services and spend their leisure time, both during the day and evening. \r\n\r\nBoxing Day, Bank Holidays and Working Hours\r\n\r\nThe Government believes that the current regulatory situation represents a fair balance between the interests of employers and workers. \r\n\r\nUnder the relevant legislation (the Working Time Regulations or WTRs), workers do not have a statutory entitlement to time off on Bank Holidays.

We will continue to work with key international partners and the UN to help the people of Syria. ","details":"The UK Government is deeply concerned about the appalling humanitarian tragedy that is unfolding in eastern Aleppo.  We are painfully aware through our many contacts on the ground of how dire and desperate the situation is there, as well as for the 587,000 people besieged by the regime in other towns in Syria.  \r\n\r\nThat is why this Government has considered the option of airdrops very carefully.  However, as the Foreign Secretary, told the House of Commons on 13 December, we came reluctantly to the conclusion that airdrops over Syria would pose too great a risk in current circumstances.  The Syrian regime has a Russian-provided comprehensive integrated air defence system designed to deny unauthorised use of Syria air space.  Russia has deployed its most advanced jet fighters and surface-to-air missiles in Syria.  There is also a very significant risk of attack by some groups on the ground, including Daesh and al-Qaeda, who may see benefit in shooting down an aid flight. Other aerial options for delivering aid, including by drones, would also run up against these challenges.\r\n\r\nBy far the best way of delivering the large amount of humanitarian assistance that is required would be by road, by trusted and neutral humanitarian partners who can ensure it gets to those who need it most. The UN has humanitarian supplies ready to reach besieged areas.   The regime and its allies could decide in a moment to allow aid in. \r\n\r\nAll International Syria Support Group (ISSG) members committed to use their influence with parties on the ground to secure access for aid convoys across Syria, including Russia and Iran.  They are uniquely placed to use their influence to ensure the regime meets its obligations and we are lobbying both governments to fulfil their ISSG commitments.  The Foreign Secretary raised our concerns when he spoke to the Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov on 22 November.  On 7 December, the Prime Minister, along with five of our closest partners, issued a statement making clear that there must be no impunity for those found to be committing war crimes and calling for Russia and Iran to use their influence with the Syrian regime to protect people and allow aid in.\r\n\r\nWe are clear that the United Nations (UN) Security Council and the wider international community need to do everything they can to make protection of civilians the highest priority, and to do everything in their power to enable aid access to besieged areas across Syria.  We therefore continue to exert multilateral diplomatic pressure for humanitarian access to be opened up across Syria.  Emergency sessions of the Security Council were held at the UK and France’s request on 30 November and 13 December to discuss Aleppo.  In his most recent intervention our Ambassador to the United Nations, Matthew Rycroft, pressed for the regime’s pitiless assault to stop and for the UN to be allowed access to help civilians on the ground.  Russia has blocked meaningful action in the UN Security Council, vetoing six UN Security Council resolutions, including one on 6 December calling for a seven day ceasefire to allow the UN to get desperately needed aid to the civilians of besieged eastern Aleppo.  \r\n\r\nOver the five years of the Syrian conflict one of our priorities has been to address the humanitarian situation through our support to international humanitarian agencies and Syrian civil society organisations.  We have pledged £2.3 billion in response to the Syria crisis, our largest ever response to a single humanitarian crisis.  This makes the UK the second largest bilateral humanitarian donor after the US.  We have also given £32.5 million of support since 2013 to Syrian Civil Defence, which has done so much to save lives and to put a spotlight on the plight of civilians caught up in this conflict.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to do all in our power to help the people of Syria.  We continue to work closely with international partners to increase pressure on those involved in this abhorrent conflict. We will continue to support the efforts of the United Nations to get humanitarian assistance to besieged and hard to reach communities in Syria.\r\n\r\nForeign and Commonwealth Office","created_at":"2017-01-05T12:07:55.192Z","updated_at":"2017-01-05T12:07:55.192Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":null,"transcript_url":"","video_url":"","overview":"The Petitions Committee has decided not to schedule a debate on this petition.

We recognise and are grateful for the bravery and skills shown by police dogs and their handlers day in and day out.\r\n\r\nThe Government agrees that attacks of any sort on police dogs or horses are unacceptable and should be dealt with severely under the criminal law. The law already allows for significant penalties to be issued to those who attack animals that support the police. An attack on a police dog or other police support animal can be treated as causing unnecessary suffering to an animal under section 4 of the Animal Welfare Act 2006. The maximum penalty is 6 months’ imprisonment, or an unlimited fine, or both. The financial element of the penalty was raised only last year from a maximum fine of £20,000. An attack on a police animal could be considered by the court as an aggravating factor leading to a higher sentence within the available range. Under some circumstances assaults on support animals could be treated as criminal damage which would allow for penalties of up to 10 years’ imprisonment.  \r\n\r\nWhilst police leaders and campaigners agree that these penalties are appropriate, I understand that it is unpalatable to think of police animals as ‘equipment’ as is inferred by the charges of criminal damage.  This does not seem to convey the respect and gratitude police and public feel for the animals involved and their contribution to law enforcement and public safety. The Government has therefore agreed to explore whether there is more that the law should do to offer the most appropriate protections to police animals and all working animals.  \r\n\r\nWhen sentencing for offences of cruelty to or neglect of animals it is for the courts to decide on an appropriate penalty based on the individual circumstances of each case. Magistrates are provided with guidelines by the Sentencing Council to help them impose appropriate sentences and penalties. The guidelines give examples of offences, aggravating and mitigating factors, as well as the range of suggested sentences and penalties for various types of offences.  The Government has requested that the Sentencing Council considers assaults on police animals as an aggravating factor as a part of their current review on guidelines for sentencing in the Magistrates’ Courts, which includes animal cruelty offences.\r\n\r\nThe Government will continue to work with the police to understand the extent of this problem.  Officials will be meeting national policing leads for police animals to discuss this issue over the coming weeks.  Police safety is an area of great concern for me, and one where I want to make sure we are doing all we can to protect frontline police officers, police staff and the animals that support them in their duties.\r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2016-11-11T15:17:31.513Z","updated_at":"2016-11-29T16:02:02.811Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":"2016-11-14","transcript_url":"https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2016-11-14/debates/D856FCAE-9EF4-49CF-99A0-AF5F379BEF94/PoliceDogsAndHorses","video_url":"http://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/b5f5b55e-3d6c-45f8-94b9-4411c366e114","overview":""}}},{"type":"petition","id":166711,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/166711.json"},"attributes":{"action":"April's Law","background":"We the undersigned call on the prime minister to make all sex offenders remain on the register for life no matter the crime, for service providers and search engines to be better policed regarding child abuse images and harder sentences on those caught with indecent images of children.","additional_details":"Five-year-old April Jones was murdered by paedophile Mark Bridger after being abducted from outside her home in Machynlleth October 2012.\r\nBefore April's abduction he was looking at child pornography.

","details":"Protecting the public from harm remains a priority for this Government, and we have been clear that those offenders who continue to pose a risk will remain subject to notification for life.  The public should rest assured that sex offenders will not automatically come off the register; the order only provides a mechanism by which a sex offender can apply for a review.   \r\n\r\nOn 30 July 2012 the Sexual Offences Act 2003 was amended by the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (Remedial) Order 2012 to introduce a mechanism which will enable registered sex offenders who are subject to notification requirements for life to apply for those requirements to be reviewed.  \r\n\r\nThis was as a result of an earlier Supreme Court ruling that our then law on indefinite sex offender registration without the right for review was incompatible with article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). \r\n\r\nThe Government fully acknowledged the ruling of the Supreme Court and took appropriate action as is its duty; to uphold the independence of the judiciary by complying with the judgement.\r\n\r\nUnder the previous Government, we made changes to the notification requirements introducing additional measures which sought to strengthen the existing mechanism by making it mandatory for all registered sex offenders to notify to the police:\r\n\r\n•\tall foreign travel;\r\n•\tweekly, where they are registered as having ‘no fixed abode’;\r\n•\twhere they are living in a household with a child under the age of 18; and;\r\n•\ttheir bank account and credit card details, and information about their passports or other identity documents.\r\n\r\nWe continue to work with the police and other law enforcement agencies to ensure that the right powers are available for the authorities to tackle sexual crimes and to bring perpetrators to justice. \r\n\r\n\r\nPolicing of child abuse images\r\n\r\nThe Government agrees that industry has a responsibility to work together with law enforcement and Government to prevent and inhibit the use of their services by those seeking to generate and share child abuse material. In 2015, Google announced that it had made changes to its search algorithm to prevent images and videos containing child abuse material from appearing in search results.  They have publicly stated there has been an eight-fold reduction in child sexual abuse image related search queries since. \r\n\r\nThe Internet Watch Foundation, which is funded by industry, has been active in facilitating the removal of indecent imagery of children from the internet. Their efforts have helped the UK see a reduction from the UK hosting 18% of web pages of child abuse imagery, to 0.2% by 2015.  Since April 2014 as permitted by Government, they have proactively sought out child sexual abuse material to take action to get this material removed.  \r\n\r\nAt the WePROTECT summit in December 2014, industry committed to taking digital hashes of known child abuse imagery in order to ensure these could be identified and referred to the US National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, and removed.  As of October 2016, over 34,750 image hashes have been shared among industry by the IWF. \r\n\r\nSentencing\r\n\r\nSentencing is entirely a matter for our independent courts.   When deciding what sentence to impose the courts take into account the circumstances of the offence and any mitigating and aggravating factors, in line with the sentencing guidelines.  Maximum penalties are kept under review to ensure that the courts have adequate powers to deal with offences effectively and proportionately.\r\n\r\nThe independent Sentencing Council are responsible for issuing guidelines to the courts.  In December 2013 the Sentencing Council issued a revised guideline on sentencing for sexual offences, which came into force in England and Wales in April 2014.  \r\n\r\nUnder the Protection of Children Act 1978 (as amended), the UK prohibits the taking, making circulation and possession with a view to distribution of any indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph of a child under 16.  Such offences carry a maximum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment.  Section 160 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 also makes the simple possession of indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs of children an offence.  This carries a maximum sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment.  This age was raised to 18 in the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and there are defences for those aged over the age of consent (16) who produce sexual photographs for their own use within a marriage or civil partnership.  These defences are lost, however, if such images are distributed. \r\n\r\nThe Sexual Offences 2003 Act significantly modernised and strengthened the laws on sexual offences in England and Wales to provide extra protection to children from sexual abuse and sexual exploitation.  It was designed to meet 21st century challenges of protecting children, and addresses issues including internet pornography and ‘grooming’ children for sexual abuse.  \r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2016-11-09T13:23:12.643Z","updated_at":"2016-11-09T13:23:12.643Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":170686,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/170686.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Replace the unelected House of Lords with a publicly elected body","background":"The House of Lords is being abused by our elected officials by filling it with cronies.

The Government is determined to ensure that all public servants have a safe and secure working environment. Any assault on someone providing a service to the public (including NHS staff) is treated extremely seriously. The fact that the victim is providing a service to the public is listed as an aggravating factor in sentencing guidelines which courts have a statutory duty to follow. As such, offenders who assault someone providing a service to the public may face a higher sentence than that for other assaults.   \r\n\r\nIf NHS staff are attacked, there should be no hesitation in involving the police. \r\n\r\nA protocol to tackle violence and anti-social behaviour in the NHS by shared actions between the Police, Crown Prosecution Service and NHS Protect was signed in 2011.

This protocol is currently being updated: the revised version is due to be in place in the coming months. \r\n\r\nFurther, the Code for Crown Prosecutors states, when considering the Public Interest Stage, “a prosecution is also more likely if the offence has been committed against a victim who was at the time a person serving the public”. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere is already a range of offences which criminalise assault or violent behaviour. These start with common assault, the maximum sentence for which is 6 months imprisonment or a fine or both.

It requires students to study a range of intellectually challenging and substantial whole texts in detail including Shakespeare, 19th-century novels, Romantic poetry, and fiction or drama from the British Isles from 1914 onwards. The content requires students to study no fewer than 15 poems by at least five different poets, and a minimum of 300 lines of poetry. The assessment arrangements must reflect those requirements and is designed to reward students who have gained a deep understanding of literature and who have read widely throughout the course. \r\n\r\nThe content also requires that students are examined on texts which they have not read previously (‘unseen’ texts).  Students will need to read widely during their studies to prepare them for the ‘unseen’ text in the exam and to be able to critically compare and contrast a range of texts using ‘relevant quotation and detailed textual references’ to demonstrate the breadth of their understanding of literature. These ‘unseen’ texts might, but do not have to be, by authors whose works students have studied as set texts. \r\n  \r\nWe do not expect awarding organisations to give or allow students to have access during their exams to copies of the whole texts they have studied. Exam boards can, however, provide students with relevant extracts. The exam boards have each chosen in their sample assessment materials to provide students with extracts of the texts they have studied. \r\n \r\nStudents should not be misled into believing that they will get good marks simply by memorising and writing out the poems or texts they have studied.  Students will not need to learn and remember the exact words of poems or texts by heart. \r\nTo gain good marks, students will need to be able to show that they are familiar with the texts - that they have studied them – and that their understanding is sufficiently developed to be able to compare them with other texts that might have been given to them in the exam. The student will need to write about a poem they have studied and that is not given to them in the exam, but that does not require them to reproduce the text in full.

They work incredibly hard for patients and deserve to be fairly rewarded. We are committed to ensuring trusts can afford to employ the staff the NHS needs. ","details":"NHS staff are our greatest asset. Despite the pressures on the NHS driven by an increasingly aged and frail population, nurses, and all our hard working NHS staff continue to put patients first, keeping them safe whilst providing the high quality care patients and their families expect.\r\n\r\nThe Government has protected NHS front line funding whilst increasing staffing levels with over 3,500 more nurses and midwives employed since May 2010 and over 51,000 nurses currently in training.\r\n\r\nHealth Education England, NHS England and the Department have taken a range of actions to boost the supply of domestically trained staff and to increase the efficiency and productivity of the existing workforce.  The NHS is already recruiting more home-grown nurses, promoting return to practice programmes and improving retention of existing staff. For example, an additional £5 million will support the Return to Practice scheme, aimed at encouraging and supporting experienced nurses who have left the profession to return. More than 2,300 returners have been on the programme, with over 700 now back in employment. Reforms to the funding of pre-registration nurse education will enable universities to significantly expand training places by the end of the parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Government greatly values the important work that Agenda for Change (AfC) staff do in delivering essential public services and it is crucial that the public sector continues to recruit, retain and motivate the highest quality staff. In responding to the 2013 Francis Enquiry into the appalling events at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, it was right that trusts wanted to ensure they had the right number of nurses to provide safe quality care. The demand for nurses was much higher than planned, but nearly three years on,  trusts cannot either provide safe quality care or balance their books; they must do both.\r\n\r\nThere is a trade-off between pay and jobs in many public services, and pay restraint is one of the many difficult choices the Government has had to make.  At Summer Budget 2015, the Government announced that it will fund public sector workforces for an average pay award of 1 percent for four years from 2016/2017.  The Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that this policy will protect 200,000 public sector jobs. Whilst pay restraint is challenging, CPI inflation has been at historic low levels, currently 0.6%. Overall earnings for nurses and other non-medical staff have increased year-on-year since 2010/11, in total by 4.0% or 0.8% a year. Average basic pay per full time equivalent has increased by more than the impact of annual pay awards.\r\n\r\nAverage earnings for qualified nurses were £31,214 in the 12 months to June 2016, a slight increase from the same time last year and above the £31,189 figure for the NHS as a whole, which remains well above the national average salary for 2015 of £27,500 a year.\r\nFor nurses and midwives employed in the NHS between March 2010 and March 2015, average total earnings (adjusted for changes in contracted hours) increased by 2.2% a year.\r\n\r\nThe NHS is one of few public sector workforces that receive incremental pay. Around half of AfC staff receive incremental pay of around 3% on average.  A typical qualified nurse (Band 5) can expect seven years of pay progression averaging around 3.8% a year, in addition to annual pay awards.\r\n\r\nWe know pay is not the only reason nurses and other health workers choose a career in the NHS. The reward package also includes a valued pension scheme and other non-pay benefits. Members of the pension scheme can generally expect to receive around £3 to £6 in pension benefits value for every £1 they contribute, while flexible working patterns help staff better manage their personal commitments.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate that housing and travel costs in London can be a barrier to recruiting and retaining the nurses and other key workers the NHS needs.  The reward package for AfC staff that work in and around London includes High Cost Area Supplements:\r\n•\t20% of basic salary, subject to a minimum payment of £4,158 and a maximum payment of £6,405 for staff that work in ‘inner’ London;\r\n•\t15% of basic salary subject to a minimum payment of £3,518 and a maximum payment of £4,483 for ‘outer’ London; and\r\n•\t5% of basic salary, subject to a minimum payment of £961and a maximum payment of £1,665 for the London ‘fringe’.\r\n\r\nThe Department is also considering how best to take account of the housing requirements for NHS staff, particularly in high-cost areas to support permanent staffing.\r\n\r\nThe 2015 NHS Staff Survey shows that for nurses and midwives morale and motivation has improved since 2014. It is critical that the NHS continues to work hard on its staff engagement strategies. We want the NHS to be a place where nurses want to work, where poor care, poor behaviour, bullying and harassment is not tolerated. We know there is a strong link between the reduction in patient standardised mortality rates and organisations with high staff engagement.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2016-11-11T13:59:50.754Z","updated_at":"2016-11-11T13:59:50.754Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":"2017-01-30","transcript_url":"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2017-01-30/debates/86C7A0AE-7CA2-4142-9B4A-A03DA115C397/AgendaForChangeNHSPayRestraint","video_url":"http://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/b18b254b-2450-4a4d-86d0-947792490a6c","overview":""}}},{"type":"petition","id":167596,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/167596.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Ban all non-recyclable/non-compostable packaging in the UK","background":"The UK fails to recycle over 1.5 million tonnes of plastic packaging waste each year, which ends up in landfill \u0026 waterways instead. \r\n\r\nCreating packaging that our society cannot deal with is blatantly unsustainable.

We will continue to encourage the use of recycled materials in products and recycling by consumers. ","details":"Almost all packaging materials are technically recyclable. However, not all may actually be recycled for a number of reasons: it may not be economically viable for a local council to collect and recycle some formats; local reprocessing infrastructure may be limited, and there may be a lack of end markets for some types of recycled materials.\r\n\r\nWe are aware of the interest in compostable packaging, but the composition of packaging remains a decision for individual businesses and their customers and consumers. It is worth noting that biodegradable materials must be properly disposed of if the benefits of such technologies are to be fully realised.  While biodegradable material may be able to reduce the impact of waste, it can also be more environmentally damaging than non-biodegradable plastic packaging if disposed of incorrectly.  If biodegradable packaging is put in the domestic waste bin it is likely to end up in landfill and break down to release methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.  Furthermore, if biodegradable packaging is mistakenly recycled with other plastics, it has the potential (when it biodegrades at a later date) to damage the quality of the new products – such as damp-proof courses for houses – made from the recycled plastic. However, the Government does support the development of sustainable biodegradable plastics and works with industry and trade organisations on this issue.\r\n\r\nIt is ultimately for businesses to decide what packaging materials they use to supply products to customers. However, retailers and their suppliers are encouraged to use materials that are widely collected for recycling wherever possible. For example, the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations place a legal obligation on UK businesses that make or use packaging to ensure that a proportion of the packaging they place on the market is recovered and recycled. This creates an incentive for companies to use less packaging and to ensure that their packaging can be recycled at end of life as it will reduce their costs in complying with the Regulations. The targets for plastic packaging are set to increase until 2020 and we are currently consulting on possible increases for other materials. \r\n\r\nBusinesses are also encouraged to reduce waste arising in the first place by using appropriately sized packaging. The Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations require businesses to ensure that all packaging does not exceed what is needed to make sure that the products are safe, hygienic and acceptable for both the packed product and for the consumer.  These Regulations apply to those responsible for the packing or filling of products into packaging and those importing packed or filled packaging into the UK from elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWorking through the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), the Government is developing and delivering activities in support of the use of recycled materials in new products and activities to stimulate its demand. For example, the Plastics Industry Recycling Action Plan has identified key actions that need to take place across the whole supply chain to ensure that recycling plastics packaging can be done sustainably. This includes design for recyclability, collections and sorting, reprocessing and development of sustainable end markets. In September last year, WRAP and an industry advisory group published a framework for greater consistency in recycling. Actions from this framework aim to identify opportunities to rationalise packaging formats (in particular plastic packaging) to those that are recyclable and for which there is a steady market, and to help local authorities to recycle a greater variety of plastics.\r\n\r\nThe Government is committed to increasing recycling rates. Current policies and regulations have resulted in a significant increase in recycling over the last decade, with recycling of packaging rising from around 46% in 2005 to 59% in 2014, but we recognise that more needs to be done. We will continue to work with businesses, local authorities and waste managers to encourage the use of recycled materials where possible in products and activities to stimulate demand.   \r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","created_at":"2017-01-17T15:20:45.206Z","updated_at":"2017-01-17T15:20:45.206Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":"2017-01-23","transcript_url":"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2017-01-23/debates/590623BD-398C-4586-A693-FCC1DB5EA444/Non-RecyclableAndNon-CompostablePackaging","video_url":"http://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/84903098-e7b6-40af-b1f7-f07e415d5a9f","overview":""}}},{"type":"petition","id":168657,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/168657.json"},"attributes":{"action":"To make votes matter, adopt Proportional Representation for UK General Elections","background":"The vast majority wants PR.

The government is determined to address this issue by improving the rigour and challenge of GCSE mathematics qualifications and by offering support to schools to improve mathematics teaching. \r\n\r\nMathematics is a formal discipline that is central to all sciences and technical fields, and is increasingly crucial to a range of other academic, professional and employment sectors. It is essential that we improve our performance in mathematics to ensure that our young people gain the knowledge and skills they need to compete in a modern economy.\r\n\r\nThe government consulted extensively on revised GCSE content, including the use of formulae. Subject content and assessment objectives for the new mathematics GCSE were published on 1 November 2013 and can be found here: \r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/gcse-mathematics-subject-content-and-assessment-objectives \r\nThe aims of the GCSE are to enable students to:\r\n•\tdevelop fluent knowledge, skills and understanding of mathematical methods and concepts; \r\n•\tacquire, select and apply mathematical techniques to solve problems;\r\n•\treason mathematically, make deduction and inferences and draw conclusions; and\r\n•\tcomprehend, interpret and communicate mathematical information in a variety of forms appropriate to the information and context.\r\nThe GCSE introduces more challenging topics at both higher and foundation tiers. Total examination time is increased, and there is a greater emphasis on problem-solving and mathematical reasoning, with more exam marks allocated to higher-order mathematics. \r\nStudents will need to memorise some previously given formulae to ensure they have grasped essential formal aspects of mathematics. Other formulae will, however, be still provided in the examination, including the surface area of a cone and a sphere, the volume of a sphere and a cone, and formulae relating to velocity, distance, acceleration and time. \r\n\r\nThe government provides over £7m annually to a network of 35 Maths Hubs – school-led centres of excellence in the teaching of mathematics. Maths Hubs support schools to deliver excellent mathematics teaching, including GCSE teaching. We also fund the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics (NCETM) and the Further Maths Support Programme (FMSP), both of which provide expertise and support to schools in the teaching of mathematics. This includes professional development courses to help teachers and schools introduce the new GCSE.

We have called for restraint, humanitarian access and an investigation. Allegations of genocide are for courts to decide.","details":"The British Government remains deeply concerned by the situation in Rakhine and the persecution of the Muslim minority Rohingya community. It is clear that the Muslim Rohingya minority are being persecuted and denied fundamental rights. The policy of the British Government is that any judgment on whether genocide has occurred is a matter for international judicial decision, rather than for governments or non-judicial bodies.\r\n\r\nWe are particularly concerned by the recent flare-up of violence. This was triggered on 9 October, when three Burmese Border Guard Police posts were attacked by Rohingya militants. We condemn this attack in which nine police and eight attackers were killed.  Since then, media, humanitarian and diplomatic access to North Rakhine has been limited by the imposition of a curfew while the military carry out security operations to root out the perpetrators and retrieve the weapons taken during the attacks.  \r\n\r\nAlthough the lack of access makes facts difficult to verify, we are deeply concerned about a growing body of anecdotal evidence suggesting human rights violations in the security response.  Reports suggest there could be a serious humanitarian impact if aid is not resumed quickly, particularly impacting those already affected by malnutrition.\r\n\r\nIn response to the latest outbreak of violence, our Ambassador visited northern Rakhine together with a number of international counterparts and the UN Resident Coordinator on 2-3 November. He has also lobbied five Ministers (most recently on 21 November), urging a restrained security response, an independent investigation and for the immediate resumption of humanitarian access. \r\n\t\t\r\nThese same messages were repeated by the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs with responsibility for human rights, Baroness Anelay, who visited Burma from 9-12 November. She called on Burmese Ministers to launch an investigation into allegations of human rights abuses, and called for an immediate resumption of humanitarian aid.\r\n\r\nThe UK also discussed the issue at the UN Security Council on 17 November, where we raised our concerns about the lack of humanitarian access.\r\n\r\nThe Government of Burma has now committed to investigating both the 9 October attacks and allegations of human rights abuses carried out during the military operations in the wake of the initial attack on 9 October. It has also given a further commitment to restore humanitarian access to northern Rakhine State. We believe our efforts are best focused on monitoring implementation of these commitments and pressing privately if they do not move forward.  We further believe the best approach to finding a long-term solution to the underlying inter-communal tensions in Rakhine State is to work with the democratically elected Government to de-escalate tensions. We do not believe expelling the Government’s representative in the UK would assist this process.\r\n\r\nSince coming into power in April, Burma’s Government has taken some encouraging steps to begin tackling the issue of Rakhine and the treatment of the Rohingya community. In August State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi announced the establishment of a new hybrid Burmese/international Rakhine Advisory Commission headed by Kofi Annan to provide advice and recommendations for a durable solution to the problems of Rakhine State. We take this announcement as a sign of the seriousness with which the NLD-led Government views the situation there.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we will continue to monitor the situation closely.  Our priority remains the resumption of humanitarian aid.  The UK has long been one of the biggest bilateral humanitarian donors to Burma and to Rakhine State. Since 2012, we have provided over £18m in humanitarian assistance, supporting work, including on sanitation and nutrition for over 126,000 people.\r\n\r\nForeign and Commonwealth Office","created_at":"2016-12-01T11:31:31.225Z","updated_at":"2016-12-01T11:31:31.225Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":169835,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/169835.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Call on the Government to urge Whirlpool UK to recall all faulty tumble dryers","background":"Following hundreds of fires caused by Whirlpool tumble dryers, we are concerned that Whirlpool have not recalled the approximately 5 million faulty dryers and have not changed their safety advice to customers, as recommended by the London Fire Brigade, who advise consumers to stop using the dryers.","additional_details":"There have been several hundred fires caused by Whirlpool tumble dryers, including on 19 August 2016, in a block of flats in Shepherds Bush, which left 26 homes uninhabitable. \r\n\r\nWe are concerned that manufacturers Whirlpool UK have failed to recall the faulty dryers, of which there are around 5 million in Britain, and have not changed their safety advice to consumers, despite the London Fire Brigade advising consumers to stop using the machines with immediate effect.","state":"open","signature_count":62655,"created_at":"2016-10-19T16:18:00.418Z","updated_at":"2017-03-11T23:10:34.379Z","open_at":"2016-11-01T10:15:42.551Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":"2017-02-27T17:16:00.872Z","scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2016-10-21T16:12:01.173Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2017-02-10T19:24:04.794Z","creator_name":"Andy Slaughter","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"Government has set up a Working Group to look at options to improve Product Recalls and Safety, and is in close contact with the enforcing authority working with Whirlpool to rectify this issue.

Consumers can reasonably expect clear advice on how to safely use products in their home, and prompt and effective action should be taken if a safety issue is identified.  \r\n\r\n•\tThe Government recognises the efforts Whirlpool has made to rectify the problem with its affected tumble dryers.  Of the 1.5 million affected appliances that consumers have registered with the manufacturer, 1.3m appliances have been modified or replaced and Whirlpool are resolving approximately 100,000 cases a month. However, the Government recognises that there remain many unregistered appliances in use across the UK.  \r\n\r\nMargot James, Minister for Small Business, Consumers and Corporate Responsibility has written to Whirlpool and met representatives of the company, urging them to progress their programme of replacement and repair, and to improve communications with consumers on this issue.  The Minister has, in particular, raised concerns about reaching out to those consumers with an affected machine who have not yet signed up for a repair or replacement.   \r\n\r\nProduct safety legislation in the UK is enforced by Local Authority Trading Standards departments.  The Government is in close contact with Peterborough City Council Trading Standards department who, as the lead regulator in this matter, have access to the most relevant information to provide a full assessment of the risk posed by the affected machines.  Peterborough Trading Standards have taken enforcement action, issuing Whirlpool with a ‘notice to warn’ that requires the company to warn consumers not to use the affected appliances until they have been modified.  The two organisations are currently working together to ensure compliance.\r\n\r\nMore generally, in October last year, the Government announced the establishment of a new Working Group on Product Recalls and Safety to look at further options to improve the safety of white goods and the recalls system. The Working Group aims to build on the good work of the Recall Review Steering Group, which was established following the Lynne Faulds-Wood review into product recalls.  \r\n\r\nThe Working Group brings together key stakeholders from a range of trade associations, product safety experts, the fire service and trading standards professionals.  The Chair is Neil Gibbins – former Deputy Chief Fire Officer for Devon and Somerset - who has a long and proven track record in fire safety and has worked with the Government and other stakeholders on the Regulators Excellence Forum.  \r\n\r\nThe Group has been tasked to develop credible recommendations to ensure that the system works well for everyone.  In particular, the Minister has asked the Group to consider and develop options around:\r\n•\tthe causes of fire in white goods and the steps we can take to reduce them;\r\n•\tways to improve the capture and use of data relating to faulty electrical goods;\r\n•\tthe value of marking white goods to preserve their identification through fire;\r\n•\tregistration of electrical products at the point of sale;\r\n•\ta code of practice for product recalls including the peer review of risk assessments; \r\n•\timproving the information available to consumers and the role of consumer education.\r\n\r\nThe Working Group passed its initial recommendations for propriety action for the Government to the Minister in December 2016.  The five recommendations are:\r\n•\tgreater co-ordination of product safety recalls and enforcement at the national level;\r\n•\tdeveloping Primary Authority Partnerships as a means of increasing access to helpful, practical advice for businesses and ensuring effective relationships between businesses and their lead regulating body;\r\n•\tdeveloping a Code of Practice on managing effective correction action including recalls;\r\n•\tgovernment support for AMDEA’s ‘Register my Appliance’ as a means to ensure consumers are informed of relevant safety issues for products they have bought;\r\n•\tundertaking research into consumer behaviour to understand how best to encourage consumers to engage with a corrective action when a problem is identified with a product.\r\n\r\nThe Group is continuing to develop an action plan and will provide a final report to the Minister in March.  \r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy","created_at":"2017-02-27T17:16:00.870Z","updated_at":"2017-02-27T17:16:00.870Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":178330,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/178330.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make the uk armed forces pensions for 22 years service tax free.","background":"The current U.K. Armed forces pensions, after 22 years service is taxable, other services are non taxable, this should be addressed and made fair across the public sector.

In 2016 different laws governing concert ticket resales were independently reviewed. The resulting report proposed no legal changes.","details":"It is an offence for an unauthorised person to sell a ticket for a designated football match in person, or via the internet under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994. The main purpose of this legislation is to ensure public order, by preventing the unauthorised resale of tickets and thus maintaining the segregation of rival fans. The same public order concerns do not apply to concert tickets where there is no significant history of disturbances between different groups of fans. \r\n\r\nThe Government has sympathy for those fans that wait anxiously for tickets to come on sale only to be frustrated when they cannot get tickets but then find that they are almost immediately being sold at a grossly inflated price on the secondary ticketing market. Professor Waterson, who undertook an independent review of online secondary ticketing such as this, took into consideration the football and Olympic legislation as well as new rules that had been set out in the Consumer Rights Act 2015.  However, in his report of 26 May 2016 (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/independent-secondary-ticketing-review-published-today) he did not recommend further legislation or the extension of the football legislation to other events. Instead he called for the existing rules to be more vigorously enforced and for the event organisers to take greater responsibility for the way the ticketing market operates. The Government will respond formally to Professor Waterson’s report in due course.\r\n\r\nConsumers and the economy benefit in various ways from the existence of a well-functioning secondary ticket market. First, it creates a safe and straightforward way for consumers who have bought tickets, often much in advance of the event, to get some money back if they cannot use them. Second it provides an opportunity to attend events for people unable or unwilling to participate in the original primary ticket sale. This may include tourists wanting to attend a local event as well as those more spontaneous in their behaviours. Depending on the popularity of the event they may have to pay a premium over those who bought tickets from the primary source, but this is a value judgment for them to make. For some events, buying tickets in the secondary ticketing market close to the actual date of the performance, may actually provide a cheaper means of access giving people who might not otherwise have been able to afford the event, the chance to do so. Not everyone wants to join the (virtual) queue to buy tickets when first on sale. For them secondary ticketing meets a consumer need. Thirdly therefore, secondary ticketing  is a viable profitable service which some people, both as purchasers and sellers, desire and banning it is liable to push such tickets onto the black market where there are less protections.  \r\n\r\nOne of the recommendations made by Professor Waterson in his review, is that primary ticket vendors do more in regards to deterring mass purchasing by individuals not intent on attending the event including those using digital ticket purchasing software (“bots”) to purchase excessive number of tickets. This currently deprives consumers of the chance to acquire tickets at the price originally established by the event organiser. He believed that organisers should seriously consider requirements for individuals to prove they are indeed individuals by means such as confirmed identity technologies. He also recommended that private ticket vendors report “bot” attacks to the police so that they can be investigated. \r\n\r\nThe Government will consider the specific issue of bots and whether there is scope for further Government intervention in this area.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Professor Waterson has produced some practical guidance that should be taken into account by consumers when purchasing tickets.

However, the Government estimates that currently only around 10% of people who should pay tax on at least part of their company's income under these rules actually do so. This non-compliance is unfair, and the most recent estimate puts the cost to the Exchequer at £440m per year which, in turn, reduces the government’s ability to fund core services used by all such as the NHS. \r\n \r\nThere are many legitimate, commercial reasons for people to work through limited companies and for businesses to engage individuals in this way. The Government recognises the benefits to the economy of having a flexible labour market, and has no intention of preventing people from working through their own companies. However, the Government does not believe that an individual’s decision to work through a company should necessarily affect the amount of tax that they pay when they are remunerated for their work.\r\n\r\nThe Government considers it crucial that public sector bodies make sure that both they and those who work for them pay the right amount of tax. As such, the Government is taking action to improve compliance with the rules in the public sector. From April 2017, individuals working through their own company in the public sector will no longer be responsible for operating the off-payroll rules. Where an individual’s company is directly engaged to a public sector body, the public sector body will be responsible for determining whether or not the rules apply, and deducting any necessary employment taxes on payments to the individual’s company. Where this engagement takes place through an agency, the public sector body will be responsible for determining whether or not the rules apply and informing the agency of this decision, in order that any necessary employment taxes can be deducted by the agency.\r\n\r\nIt’s important to note that this change does not introduce a new liability, but is designed to ensure that the current rules work as intended. Legislation to stop individuals reducing their tax bill by working through a limited company has been in place for more than 15 years. Furthermore, these rules will not lead to self-employed individuals paying employment taxes; the rules only apply to those who would have been employed if they were engaged directly. Indeed, many public sector bodies are already required to check that some off-payroll workers are paying the correct taxes. This change will extend this requirement across the entire public sector workforce, and make the public sector body or agency responsible for paying the taxes, rather than just checking they have been paid. \r\n\r\nAs is currently the case, falling within the off-payroll tax rules will not change an individual’s status for employment rights as there is no direct link between employment taxes and these rights. However, those who wish to challenge their employment status for employment rights can take their case to an employment tribunal whether or not they are classified as employed for tax purposes.\r\n\r\nThe Government recognises concerns that determining whether or not the rules apply can be administratively demanding. In response to this, HMRC are developing an online tool that will help public sector bodies to determine whether or not the rules apply. This will provide certainty and clarity for all those who are required to make a determination, ensuring that only those who would have been employees if they were engaged directly will have to pay employment taxes.\r\n\r\nHM Treasury \r\n","created_at":"2017-02-08T15:42:40.945Z","updated_at":"2017-02-08T15:42:40.945Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":170006,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/170006.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Set up Independent Pump-Watch body to monitor and regulate vehicle fuel pricing","background":"You may be surprised to learn that how much we pay to fill up our cars vans and trucks isn’t regulated at all.

A competitive market is the best way to keep prices low; a new regulator is not necessary.","details":"The Government believes that it is essential that consumers get a fair deal and that falls in oil prices are passed on to lower retail prices without unnecessary delay.  This can most effectively be achieved through an open and competitive market, which drives prices down.  We will therefore continue to make it clear to industry that we expect it to pass any savings that result from lower oil prices onto customers.  \r\n\r\nThe Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy monitors and publishes weekly national average pump prices: \r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/oil-and-petroleum-products-weekly-statistics\r\n\r\nAnalysis by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy suggests that on average, at a national level, crude price changes are fully passed through into pump prices within 6-7 weeks. This time represents wholesale contractual arrangements and the time taken for fuel to be delivered to filling stations through the supply chain. There is no evidence to suggest that, for given changes in crude oil prices, retail prices rise faster than they fall.\r\n\r\nMovements in pump prices are primarily driven by crude oil prices; though are also influenced by a range of other factors; including refining capacity, stock levels, biofuels cost, distribution costs and retail margins. Tax and duty is the largest single component of retail petrol and diesel prices; as fuel duty is charged at a fixed rate per litre, retail product prices are therefore always less volatile than crude prices. A reduction in crude oil prices will consequently produce a less than proportionate reduction in retail product prices. Another factor affecting the relationship between crude prices and the retail price of oil products is the exchange rate. Crude oil and oil products are traded in dollars, and so when the value of pound sterling decreases against the dollar, oil becomes more expensive for UK consumers.\r\n\r\nThe Office of Fair Trading’s call for information on the petrol and diesel sector, published in 2013, found that competition in the road fuels sector was working relatively effectively, although it was found that fuel is often significantly more expensive at motorway service stations. Action has since been taken at Autumn Statement 2014 to trial new road signs that display motorway service station petrol and diesel prices for motorway drivers. The aim of the trial is to determine whether the new fuel comparison price signs are effective in providing useful information to road users and to understand the impact of improving fuel price transparency on driver behaviour and fuel prices at Motorway Service Areas. \r\n\r\nCommercially managed Apps or Websites are also available for motorists that provide price comparisons between petrol stations to help them to save money.  \r\n\r\nFrom this analysis we do not think that establishing a new regulator with the associated costs of establishing such a body would be justified.  The sector is subject to the normal competition and consumer protection law.  \r\n\r\nOn 1st April 2014 the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) became the UK's lead competition and consumer body. The CMA brought together the existing competition and certain consumer protection functions of the Office of Fair Trading and the responsibilities of the Competition Commission. The CMA will work to promote competition for the benefit of consumers, both within and outside the UK. Its aim is to make markets work well for consumers, businesses and the economy. If people have evidence of anti-competitive practices in the fuel supply sector they should pass this to the CMA.  \r\n\r\nThe Government recognises fuel costs remain a significant part of both business and household costs. This is why at Budget 2016 the Government announced that fuel duty will be frozen for the sixth successive year.  The Government has frozen fuel duty in every year from 2011 to lessen the impact of high fuel prices on households and business costs.  By the end of 2016-17, fuel duty will have been frozen for seventh successive years resulting in the longest fuel duty freeze for 40 years. \r\n\r\nIn addition, people living across seventeen of the UK’s most rural communities benefit from a 5 pence per litre relief on fuel duty. The scheme allows 125,000 people living in the selected areas, who currently face some of the highest fuel prices in the country despite depending on cars for transport, to benefit from cheaper fuel. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy","created_at":"2016-12-08T10:07:18.244Z","updated_at":"2016-12-08T10:07:18.244Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":174321,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/174321.json"},"attributes":{"action":"The NHS must never be privatised and remain a free, publicly funded UK service.","background":"The NHS is the bedrock of a fair and compassionate society, which is what any decent, caring person should be aspiring to be part of.

We recognise the NHS, moreover, as part of the social fabric of this country and the single most important public service.  That’s why we believe in the NHS and its values. \r\n\r\nThe vast majority of NHS care has and will continue to be provided by public sector organisations.  Any decision about use of the private sector is for local commissioners.  We are clear though, that patients should be able to access the best possible treatments based on quality of care not the type of provider.\r\n\r\nThe principles the NHS was founded on will remain as important in the future as they were when the NHS was created: of healthcare free at the point of use, funded from general taxation and available to all based on need rather than the ability to pay.  Clinical services will continue to be available on the basis of need, as they are now.\r\n\r\nWe know that the NHS is facing many challenges and there are increasing pressures on all parts of the health and care system due to, amongst other things, an ageing population, changing public expectations and the cost of new drugs. However we have more doctors, more nurses, more paramedics all delivering more treatments than ever, funded by a budget at record levels.\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember though, that the pressures faced by the NHS are common to most developed health systems, regardless of how the system is funded.  There is no evidence to suggest that tax funded systems are less effective or efficient than any other system.  The OECD has said that “no broad type of healthcare system performs systematically better than another in improving the population’s health status in a cost-effective manner”.\r\n\r\nThe NHS and wider health system has already examined what needs to be done to ensure the sustainability of the health and care system.  This is why in the Spending Review in November 2015, the Government committed to increase funding for the NHS in England, with funding to be £10 billion higher in real terms by 2020-21, compared to 2014-15.  This is the money that the NHS in England asked for and will support the NHS’s own plan for its future – the Five Year Forward View – which set out what needs to change and how this can be achieved.  And £6 billion of this will be frontloaded by the end of this year, kick starting the process of change, and enabling the Government to deliver Government objectives including seven day services and improved access to cancer treatments and mental health services.  The Five Year Forward View is available on NHS England’s website – https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5yfv-web.pdf. \r\n\r\nAnd this has been committed in spite of the continuing fiscal challenges.  It is also the case that NHS spending has increased as a proportion of total Government spending every year since 2010.

Woodcock, snipe and golden plover are amongst those species that may be taken. In England and Wales the dates for woodcock are 1 October to 31 January; common snipe 12 August to 31 January; golden plover 1 September to 31 January.\r\n \r\nShooting is a legitimate activity and in addition to providing jobs and investment in some of our most remote areas, it can offer important benefits for wildlife and habitat conservation. The Government’s manifesto commits to protect shooting for the benefits it brings to individuals, the environment and the rural economy.\r\n\r\nRecent data shows that the woodcock has a breeding population or around 78,000 pairs; common snipe 76,000 and golden plover between 38,000 and 59,000. Overwintering populations increase their numbers to approximately 1.4 million (woodcock), 1 million (common snipe) and 400,000 (golden plover). The numbers in winter are greatly increased as a result of birds arriving from Scandinavia, the Baltic States and Russia and many of our breeding birds (and their offspring) leave the country in winter.  \r\n\r\nFor all three species, the numbers of birds hunted is small compared with the population present in the country during the open season.\r\n\r\nWhen combined with the fact that many of our breeding birds winter abroad, it is unlikely that hunting pressure in this country has played a significant role in the recent downwards trends in the size and range of GB breeding populations of either woodcock or snipe. There is little evidence that the golden plover is currently in decline in GB as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for any declines are complex and include habitat loss as a result of land drainage, the drying out of natural woodlands, declining woodland management, the maturation of new plantations, overgrazing by deer, recreational disturbance and reductions in prey availability. The woodcock is currently red-listed due to breeding range decline in the past 25 years.\r\n\r\nMeasures have been taken to improve habitats through Environmental Land Management schemes such as the Countryside Stewardship Scheme, where grassland breeding waders have been specifically targeted. The woodcock will have benefited from Woodland Grant Schemes, some of which specifically target management for declining woodland birds.\r\n\r\nThe Government is not persuaded that the current level of hunting has a significant detrimental impact on the numbers of woodcock, common snipe and golden plover. A number of English estates have already instigated their own voluntary bans on the shooting of woodcock.

The contact also provides a link through to the Royal British Legion knowledge database where advice can be provided on line for most cases.\r\n\r\nIn 2016, NHS England ran an extensive engagement exercise of their current veteran’s mental health services to seek views and experiences of these services exploring the reasons why some people have not sought or received support and treatment. Following the findings, a pathfinder transition, intervention and liaison mental health service for armed forces serving personnel approaching discharge and after discharge has been commissioned. \r\n\r\nIn addition, up to £18m of NHS England specialist funding is being provided to Combat Stress to provide acute PTSD mental services for veterans. \r\n\r\nRaising awareness of the armed forces community and their mental health and physical needs is imperative to ensure individuals receive high-quality support in a timely manner. Health Education England working with NHS England and welfare charities have produced a package of e-learning modules aimed at all health and social care professionals, to help increase understanding of the armed forces population and facilitate improved care and treatment.

In addition, the STPCD makes clear that governing bodies and headteachers must ensure that teachers are able to achieve a satisfactory work/life balance. In 2014 the School Teachers’ Review Body (STRB) undertook a review of teachers’ non-pay terms and conditions.  After considering evidence from the teaching unions, the employers and the Government, the STRB recommended that the principles underlying those conditions, including PPA time and work/life balance, remained appropriate and should be retained.

We are consulting on our proposed national funding formula, and we are keen to hear from as many people as possible.","details":"Please respond online here:\r\nhttps://consult.education.gov.uk/funding-policy-unit/schools-national-funding-formula2/\r\n\r\nThe Government has protected the core schools budget in real terms for the duration of this Parliament.  School funding is at its highest level on record, and will be over £40bn in 2017-18. Additionally, as school funding is driven by pupil numbers, where pupil numbers rise, the amount of money schools receive will also increase.\r\n\r\nBut the system for distributing that record amount of funding is unfair, opaque and outdated.  Similar schools, educating similar pupils, receive very different levels of funding with little or no justification, because the system is based on historic data and has not kept up with changes since it was established more than a decade ago. We are determined to end this postcode lottery and make sure that funding is consistent across the country, rather than depending on where children happen to live.  That is why we are introducing a national funding formula for schools.\r\nThe national funding formula does not affect how much money is available for schools overall – it is purely about ensuring that that money is distributed more fairly across the country.  The national funding formula will mean that, for the first time, we will have a clear, simple and transparent system that matches funding to children’s needs and the school they attend.  More than half of England’s schools, many of which have been under funded for years, will see their funding increase as a result of our reforms.\r\n  \r\nThe biggest element of our formula will be basic per-pupil funding.  This will make up about three-quarters of the total funding and means that every child, regardless of circumstances, will attract a consistent amount of money to their school.\r\nWe also want to support schools as they continue to work to break the link between disadvantage and attainment.  So we think it is right that schools serving children with additional needs, who face entrenched barriers to their success, benefit from extra resources to help support these children.  That is why we are also proposing to target money towards pupils who have additional needs through the formula.\r\n\r\nWe have thought very carefully about how to help schools that are losing funding manage the transition to the new system. We have built significant protections into the formula, so that no school will face a reduction of more than more than 1.5% per pupil per year, or 3% per pupil overall.  This limits the otherwise very large reductions that some schools would have seen, which we know would have been unmanageable. \r\n\r\nWe are also continuing to work with schools to help them use their funding in the most efficient way.\r\n   \r\nTo support schools to improve their financial health and efficiency we have produced a collection of tools, information and guidance, https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/schools-financial-health-and-efficiency\r\nincluding benchmarking tools and case studies of best practice, to help schools make savings. \r\n\r\nMost recently, we published the Schools’ Buying Strategy, \r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/schools-buying-strategy\r\nto support schools to make significant savings, over £1bn a year by 2019-20, in non-pay and procurement costs. We also launched Workforce Planning Guidance,\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/school-workforce-planning\r\nwhich contains links to advice and case studies, as well as lists of options and questions for school leaders to consider when reviewing their staff structures.\r\n\r\nCreating any national funding formula involves balancing the core funding that every child attracts, and the extra funding targeted to those with additional needs; and balancing increases for those that are due to see gains with stability for those schools that are due to see losses.  We are consulting for a full 3 months on our proposals to ensure we get them right.  We are keen to hear views from as many schools, governors, local authorities and parents as possible.

Please tell us what you think through the consultation.","details":"We are consulting on further reform of the Work Capability Assessment (WCA). On 31 October we launched a Green Paper consultation on how we can further improve the process, such as through separating decisions on financial support from decisions on employment support. We are also consulting on how we can simplify and streamline assessments - particularly for those with the most severe health conditions and disabilities. Over the coming months we will be consulting with disabled people and those who have health conditions, as well as with carers, families, professionals, and a range of organisations who, like us, want to see further change. \r\n\r\nWhile reforming the welfare system so that the greatest number of people possible have the opportunity to lead a full and fulfilling life in work, we are protecting those who, through disability or ill health, are unable to work. We are conscious that it is of vital importance that while supporting so many people in such a range of circumstances, we treat every individual with the dignity and humanity they deserve.\r\n\r\nThere are circumstances in which we carry out internal reviews to establish whether anything related to an individual’s benefit claim should have been done differently. These could include cases where a complaint has been made by somebody who has been identified as vulnerable, or where we receive information that an individual has attempted or completed suicide and it is alleged that Departmental activity may have contributed to this – in these latter circumstances a review is mandatory.\r\n\r\nIt is a mechanism to get a factual account of events related to the individual’s claim, without opinion or judgement attached. The fact that a review has been carried out does not of itself imply that the Department was at fault.\r\n\r\nIn order to protect individual claimants as much as possible, a number of safeguards have been built into Employment and Support Allowance (ESA); some since its inception and others subsequently - some as a result of recommendations made in the independent reviews of the WCA.\r\n\r\nFor instance, Visiting Officers can visit individuals in their own homes if concerns have been raised about their vulnerability. As well as helping to complete benefit claims they can explain any requirements placed on claimants at various stages of their claim, and the consequences of not doing so without good reason. They can also relay concerns back to the Department if they are particularly concerned about an individual’s welfare. This could result in the person taking a decision contacting the claimant’s GP, social services department or, for example, their community mental health nurse if they have one.\r\n\r\nIn cases where it is likely a claimant will be found fit for work, the claimant is contacted by telephone to review the information already held, and to request any additional information that they could consider before making their decision. If they do then decide to find the claimant fit for work, they explain to the claimant that their ESA award will stop, and advise them which benefits they could apply for. The Department will make two separate attempts to contact the claimant; in cases where the claimant is vulnerable and cannot be contacted they will arrange a safeguarding home visit to the claimant. \r\n\r\nIf claimants are unhappy with the decision on their benefit claim they can ask for a mandatory reconsideration, where all of the evidence is looked at again by a different Decision Maker. As part of this process the claimant will be asked if there is any other evidence or information that they would like to be considered. If, following a mandatory reconsideration, the claimant is still not satisfied with the decision they have the right to lodge an appeal at the First-tier Tribunal.\r\n\r\nThe fairness of the welfare system remains one of its most important characteristics, and we are keen to make further improvements wherever possible. That’s why the Secretary of State announced on 1 October that we are stopping ESA reassessments for those with the most severe and life-long conditions, as well as announcing on 16 November that we want to ensure the sanctions system works for people with mental health problems and that from next year jobseekers who are homeless or who have a mental health condition will be able to immediately access hardship payments if they receive a benefit sanction.

Non-EU workers must have a skilled job and pay towards the NHS. Brexit will allow us to get more control of EU migration. ","details":"The immigration system has a role to play in supporting growth and meeting the needs of UK businesses.  Migrant workers fill skills gaps in our labour market and help to boost our economy.  We also welcome international students who want to come to study at our world-leading universities and are committed to making sure we attract the brightest and the best.\r\n\r\nUncontrolled, however, mass immigration makes it difficult to maintain social cohesion, puts pressure on public services and can drive down wages for people on low incomes.  That is why we are committed to reducing net migration to sustainable levels.\r\n\r\nThe context that Australia operates in is very different to the UK.  It has a low population density and there is public support for increased legal migration.  The net immigration rate in Australia is, in proportion to their population, three times ours at 240,000 per year on a population one third of the UK’s.  \r\n\r\nThe Australian points-based system forms only a part of the work migration system and is intended primarily for job seekers, not employers (who have a different route for recruitment).  As the Prime Minister has said many times in the past, a points-based system will not work and is not an option. It would give foreign nationals the right to come to the UK if they meet certain criteria, instead of ensuring that decisions on who comes to the country are based on our economic needs and reside with the Government.\r\n\r\nOur immigration system is designed to meet the UK’s specific needs.  We are putting an end to automatic entry where points tests are met and placing more emphasis on credibility testing.  We have closed routes which allowed migrants to come to the UK without a skilled job offer to look for work. There is a renewed emphasis on migrants being selected by sponsors such as employers and universities, with sponsors being made accountable for their choices. To qualify for a Tier 2 work visa, non-EU nationals must have a specific job offer from an employer which has been licensed by the Home Office to sponsor migrant workers.\r\n\r\nWe have capped the number of migrants outside the EU who can come here to work and are ensuring that only those who make a real economic contribution can come. We have also closed almost 1,000 bogus colleges, and increased scrutiny of sham marriages. We are removing more foreign national offenders than ever before and have legislated to stop illegal migrants operating under the radar.\r\n\r\nApplicants coming to the UK to work, study or join family need to provide documentation and must have sufficient money to support themselves without relying on public funds.  Those coming for more than six months must pay an immigration health surcharge to ensure they make a fair contribution towards the costs of the NHS.\r\n\r\nAs we conduct the negotiations to leave the EU, it must be a priority to regain more control of the numbers of people who come here from Europe.  The precise way in which we will do this is yet to be determined. There are a whole range of issues to consider, not just how to bring control through the rules for people coming in, but also crucially the activities they are permitted to undertake when they are here.\r\n\r\nAt every step of the negotiations, the Government will work to ensure the best possible outcome for the British people. We are about to begin these negotiations and it would be wrong to set out unilateral positions in advance.\r\n\r\nOur reforms since 2010 have already made it more difficult for EU migrants to claim benefits in the UK and, through the landmark Immigration Act, made it tougher for illegal immigrants to remain by restricting access to work, housing, benefits, healthcare, bank accounts and driving licences and making it easier to remove those who have no right to be here by reducing the number of appeals.\r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2017-02-24T14:27:59.590Z","updated_at":"2017-02-24T14:27:59.590Z"},"debate":null}}]}
