From that time onwards, only a person who has a direct connection with the UK has the right of abode, and all others are subject to the Immigration Rules introduced under that Act. Although Hong Kong was still a colony in 1973, its inhabitants were not given the right of abode under the Immigration Act 1971 and, unless they had another tie – such as existing residence in the UK – they were subject to immigration control. Under the British Nationality Act 1981 persons from Hong Kong became British Dependent Territory citizens (BDTCs) but this did not affect their position regarding immigration status in the UK.\r\n\r\nWhen Hong Kong became a Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China on 1 July 1997, it was no longer possible to retain or acquire BDTC by virtue of a connection with Hong Kong. However, in the ten years immediately prior to the handover persons who would otherwise be BDTCs were eligible to apply for British National (Overseas) BN(O) status. This does not give the holder the ability to reside in the UK – reflecting the position prior to 1997 – but it does give a person the ability to use a British travel document and to be afforded consular protection should they travel outside of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region or the People’s Republic of China.\r\n\r\nOf the varying forms of British nationality, only British citizens and certain British subjects have the right of abode in the UK, reflecting the provisions of the British Nationality Act 1981. BN(O)s, being subject to immigration control, are not treated any differently in terms of the criteria to enter or reside in the UK.\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of the British Nationality Act 1981, the only way that anyone can obtain the right of abode in the UK is by becoming a British citizen. Ministers do not have discretion to grant the right of abode outside of legislation, and there are no plans to amend the law to that effect.\r\n\r\nIn his 2007 Review of Citizenship, Lord Goldsmith recognised that to automatically give BNOs full British citizenship would be a breach of the commitments made between China and the UK in the 1984 Joint Declaration on the future of Hong Kong.\r\n\r\nHowever, BNOs can be registered as British citizens in certain circumstances:\r\na) If a person lives in the UK for a period of five years, and meets the specified residence requirements, they can apply for registration under section 4(2) of the British Nationality Act 1981. Those applying under this section are not required to demonstrate the knowledge of English and knowledge of Life in the UK requirements. \r\nb) The British Nationality Hong Kong Act 1997 also provides for the registration of British nationals who would otherwise be stateless and are ordinarily resident in Hong Kong. \r\nc) BNOs can also apply for registration under section 4B of the 1981 Act if they do not have another citizenship or nationality.\r\n\r\nFurther information can be found on the GOV.UK website: https://www.gov.uk/apply-citizenship-british-nationality\r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2018-12-12T15:01:16.209Z","updated_at":"2018-12-14T15:00:29.034Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":223069,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/223069.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Mandatory EHCPs  for children with Autism.","background":"As a parent to a little boy with autism it's something I feel very strongly about.It's an injustice not to put appropriate supports in school for children with a disability.","additional_details":"","state":"open","signature_count":11892,"created_at":"2018-06-26T07:51:23.419Z","updated_at":"2019-01-01T20:41:15.920Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-07-02T15:44:39.444Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-06-26T10:14:27.338Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2018-10-17T21:52:28.348Z","government_response_at":"2018-10-30T09:36:02.331Z","debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Dianne Mortimore","rejection":null,"government_response":{"responded_on":"2018-10-30","summary":"The widely ranging needs of the children and young people on the autistic spectrum are best met by the current graduated SEN system, rather than one requiring mandatory EHC plans for all.","details":"We introduced significant reforms to help all children, no matter what their special educational need or disability (SEND), to be able to reach their full potential and receive the right support to succeed in their education and their adult lives. \r\n\r\nChildren and young people with autism have a range of individual needs and some have other additional SEND as well as autism. The SEND system introduced through the Children and Families Act 2014 is aimed at identifying and meeting a range of diverse needs. Schools should be monitoring the progress of all their pupils and intervening where learning difficulties are identified, providing ‎the 'graduated approach' known as SEN support. This is a cycle of assessment, planning, intervention and review used by schools and colleges to assist them to identify needs and continuously support progress. Schools and colleges are required to use their best endeavours to support children and young people’s needs. \r\n\r\nWhere this approach is applied in a timely and effective way, the majority of children and young people with autism can and do achieve well in their education without an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plan. In January 2018 14.6% of the school population were identified with SEN and just 2.9% of these had an EHC plan. \r\n\r\nIf a child or young person, including those with autism, does not make expected progress in response to the support being provided by the school, or the support required exceeds the school or colleges’ SEND provision, the school or college, or the parents/carers of the child or young person, or the young person themselves, can ask the local authority to carry out an EHC needs assessment, provided one has not taken place in the previous six months. All local authorities have a duty under the Children and Families Act 2014 to carry out assessments and draw up EHC plans where necessary and they must look at each request for an assessment individually. \r\n\r\nMany children and young people with autism do have an EHC plan. 28.2% of all the pupils with EHC plans in January 2018 had autism identified as their primary need, the most common type of need overall (School Census). Out of 119,909 pupils with a primary need of autism, 55% had an EHC plan (or statement) and 45% were on SEN support.  Identification of children with autism who need plans has increased each year since 2010. Children and young people with autism are being identified for EHC plans where necessary. \r\n\r\nChildren and young people with autism have especially benefitted from the person-centred, multi-agency, participative approach of the reformed SEND system and its focus on good progress and successful supported transition to adulthood. The system is based on meeting individuals’ needs rather than the creating mandatory categories of groups of children with SEND.  \r\n\r\nWe have funded the Autism Education Trust (AET) since 2011 to deliver autism awareness and autism training to education staff in early years, schools and further education settings and it has so far reached more than 190,000 people - not just teachers and teaching assistants, but also support staff such as receptionists, dining hall staff and caretakers, encouraging a ‘whole school’ approach to supporting pupils with autism.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education","created_at":"2018-10-30T09:36:02.329Z","updated_at":"2018-10-30T09:36:02.329Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":223075,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/223075.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Reduce VAT to 5% on repairs and approved alterations to listed buildings.","background":"Private listed property owners are preserving much of Britain’s built heritage for future generations, yet many are struggling to maintain and repair their homes.

Entitlement to State Pension is based on rules at the time of the claim.","details":"The equalisation of State Pension age was introduced against a background of a wide consultation on the policy.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, after 2 years of debate in Parliament and following public consultation, the Government brought in a law to equalise men and women’s State Pension age (SPa). This increased the earliest age when a woman could claim State Pension (SP) from 60 to 65. The Government planned for the original change to take place over 10 years between 2010 and 2020.\r\n\r\nThe Government has gone to significant lengths to communicate SPa changes. Over the last 18 years the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has provided over 25 million personalised State Pension estimates to people who requested them. It has encouraged people to request these as part of their long-term financial planning – after all, retirement is a life changing financial decision and people are expected to plan for this.\r\n\r\nThe equalisation of men and women’s SPa was often reported in the media and debated at length in Parliament. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) produced communications materials relating to increases in State Pension age (SPa) for both men and women, and carried out a pension’s education campaign between 2001 and 2004. This included information on the future equalisation of SPa. Later DWP sent individual letters to those affected. \r\n\r\nBecause of increases in life expectancy the Government needed to make further changes to State Pension age subsequent to Pensions Act 1995 to ensure that the state pension was affordable and sustainable over the long term. In 2007 it introduced a law to increase SPa for everyone to 66 by 2026, to 67 by 2036 and to 68 by 2046. In 2011 it introduced another law to equalise men and women’s SPa more quickly. The 2011 law also brought forward the increase in everyone’s SPa from 65 to 66 by five and a half years.\r\n\r\nThe terms of entitlement to State Pension has to be seen in the context that the State Pension is a Social Security benefit funded through National Insurance contributions.\r\n\r\nThe payment of the State Pension benefit is dependent on reaching the age of eligibility which can be amended through primary legislation. There is no legal contract for the pension between the state and an individual. The National Insurance scheme operates on a 'pay-as-you-go' basis. This means that today’s contributors are paying for today’s social security entitlements and pensions, and those paying contributions previously were paying for the pensioners of that time. In other words, contributors do not accumulate an individual pension fund of actual monies they have paid, which is personal to them. Instead, payment of contributions entitles them or, in certain circumstances, their spouses to a range of social security entitlements which are available on the basis of the rules applicable at the time of the claim.\r\n\r\nWith Government facing increasing financial pressures, it is simply not justified to reverse the policy on State Pension age equalisation. As an example, women who reached State Pension age in 2016 are estimated to receive more State Pension on average over their lifetime than women ever have before.\r\n\r\nWe will be making no further changes to the law on this issue. Doing so would mean working-age people, especially younger people, bearing a greater financial burden to support the rising costs of the pensions system. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions","created_at":"2018-12-20T22:32:55.398Z","updated_at":"2018-12-20T22:32:55.398Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":225395,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/225395.json"},"attributes":{"action":"UK to refer Sri Lanka to ICC in March 2019","background":"Refer Sri Lanka to International Criminal Court, if it continues to fail to implement its commitment made to the UNHRC Res.

We are encouraging further progress on these issues, as well as encouraging the Government of Sri Lanka to deliver meaningful devolution through constitutional reform, and to establish credible mechanisms for transitional justice. Minister for Asia and the Pacific Mark Field raised these issues with the Government of Sri Lanka during his visit in October, and subsequently made three public statements – on 26 and 29 October, and 9 November – urging Sri Lanka to fully implement the commitments it has made to the UN Human Rights Council. \r\n\r\nThe UK is committed to supporting the Sri Lankan Government’s efforts to improve the human rights situation in the country.  The UK is providing Sri Lanka with £8.3 million of Conflict, Stability and Security Fund funding over three years, including support for police reform and training, reconciliation and peace building, and resettlement and demining in the north of the country.\r\n\r\nForeign \u0026 Commonwealth Office","created_at":"2018-12-19T10:09:28.817Z","updated_at":"2018-12-19T10:09:28.817Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":230140,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/230140.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Raise the Rate: increase the national funding rate for sixth form students","background":"Sixth form funding was subject to deep cuts after 2010 and the national funding rate for 16 and 17 year olds has remained frozen at £4,000 per student, per year since 2013/14.

We know what a vital role the sector is playing in making sure people have the skills they need.\r\n\r\nHowever, as with other areas of Departmental spending, 16-19 education funding from 2020 onwards will be considered as part of the next Spending Review.  \r\n\r\nWe are planning to invest nearly £7 billion this academic year to make sure there is a place in education or training, including for apprenticeships, for every 16 to 19 year old.  We have also protected the base rate of funding for all 16 to 19 year old students until 2020 and our commitment to the sector has contributed to the current record high proportion of 16 and 17 year olds who are participating in education or apprenticeships.\r\n\r\nWe are currently delivering a major programme of skills reform and are transforming technical education through the introduction of new T Levels from 2020.  To support the delivery of these new qualifications we will be investing an additional £500m funding per year once the programme is fully rolled out.  We understand that not all providers will be delivering T Levels, however, this does represent a significant investment in our young people and in the 16 to 19 system.\r\n\r\nWhilst we are currently focusing on the introduction of T Levels and reforms to the apprenticeship system, this does not eclipse the crucial importance of the academic curriculum, or the key role FE and sixth form schools and colleges play in delivering this. Under the current funding arrangements, 16-19 institutions receive enough funding to deliver established study programmes including three A Levels.  Additional funding of over £500 million is available to provide extra support to disadvantaged students and students on large study programmes.  Extra funding was also announced in the 2017 Autumn Budget to support institutions to grow participation in level 3 maths, and the first of this funding will be included in 2019/20 allocations. \r\n\r\nWe are listening to the feedback we have received from the sector and are continuing to look carefully at post-16 education funding in preparation for the next Spending Review.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education","created_at":"2019-01-02T15:37:36.785Z","updated_at":"2019-01-02T15:37:36.785Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":223221,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/223221.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Ban the importation of animal fur into the UK","background":"The UK government has already limited the importation of animal fur into the UK by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3254/91, however certain animal fur can still be imported, some from countries with poor animal welfare rights.

The response of people indicates that up and down the country security checks are very patchy.

There are some good examples too, but on the whole there is a feeling of unease about lack of security.
