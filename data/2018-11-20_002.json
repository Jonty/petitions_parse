Under the current law, anyone who continues to carry a knife or gun can expect to face a custodial sentence.","details":"The Government takes the possession of firearms, knives and offensive weapons extremely seriously. We are taking significant action to both prevent and respond to crimes involving weapons through the Serious Violence Strategy and the Offensive Weapons Bill. \r\n\r\nIt is the responsibility of Parliament to provide a sentencing framework which gives the courts the powers they need to effectively deal with the range of offences and offenders which come before them. Parliament sets the maximum penalty for an offence and it is for the independent courts to determine the appropriate sentence, taking into account the circumstances of each case. Sentencing must be proportionate to the offence committed and sentencing decisions include consideration of the seriousness of the offence, determined in the main by the harm caused or risked being caused by the offence and the culpability of the offender. It is already the case that for any offence the use of weapon will be treated as an aggravating factor meriting an increased sentence.\r\n\r\nThe UK already has some of the toughest firearms laws in the world. Those convicted of possession of a firearm are liable to a minimum custodial sentence – for 18, 19 and 20 year olds this is 5 years’ detention in a young offender institute; adults aged 21 or over face a minimum of 5 years’ imprisonment; young people aged 16 or 17 face a minimum of 3 years’ detention. Given that custody for young offenders is a last resort and should only be used for the most serious offences, the gravity of carrying a gun is reflected by the very fact that there is a minimum custodial sentence for under 18s. The maximum sentence for possession of a firearm is 10 years’ custody. \r\n\r\nIn 2015, we introduced minimum custodial sentences for repeat knife possession and offences that involve threatening with a weapon. Adults face a minimum of 6 months’ imprisonment whilst young people aged 16 or 17 face a minimum four-month Detention and Training Order. Since the introduction of the minimum custodial term people caught carrying a knife or offensive weapon for a second time are now more likely than ever before to go to prison – recent statistics show that 83% of offenders received a custodial sentence for repeat possession offences. The maximum sentence for possession of a knife or offensive weapon is 4 years’ custody.  \r\n\r\nMinistry of Justice.\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-19T12:25:37.538Z","updated_at":"2018-11-19T12:25:37.538Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":227405,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/227405.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Scrap The Forestry Commission Licence Agreements With Fox \u0026 Hare Hunts","background":"The Forestry Commission licences ‘trail hunts’ (fox, beagle \u0026 harrier packs) to use public land with staff convicted under the Hunting Act 2004 \u0026 Protection of Badgers Act 1992.

The Forestry Commission only permits trail hunting on its land under strictly controlled agreements.","details":"The Hunting Act 2004 came into effect on 18 February 2005 and bans all hunting of wild mammals with dogs in England and Wales, except where it is carried out in accordance with the exemptions set out in Schedule 1 to the Act. \r\n\r\nMany hunts have since turned to trail hunting as an alternative to live quarry hunting, which involves the hunting of an artificial scent, or the scent of a fox, deer or mink, to mimic live quarry racing. A huntsman will go out ahead of the field and lay a trail; the dogs and followers will then follow this trail. Because the huntsmen or followers do not know in advance the route hounds will take when following the trail, trail hunting tends to closely match traditional live quarry hunting.\r\n\r\nIt is for the Forestry Commission to decide whether to permit trail hunting on its land.\r\n  \r\nThe Forestry Commission only permits trail hunting on the Public Forest Estate (PFE) to members of the Masters of Fox Hounds Association (MFHA) and the Masters of Draghounds and Bloodhounds Association (MDBA). The Forestry Commission enters into master agreements with the MFHA and MDBA, which strictly govern the terms under which trail and drag hunting are permitted on the PFE.\r\n\r\nThe agreements oblige each hunt to obtain a separate permission from the Forest Management Director of the District to trail and drag hunt on the PFE and to agree dates and routes four weeks prior to the commencement of the season in November.\r\n\r\nThe permission obliges the hunt to maintain £5 million liability insurance and indemnify the Forestry Commission against any damage or loss. The permission also strictly enforces the byelaws of the Forestry Commission and gives the Forest Management Director the ability to restrict the number of hounds and manner of hunting.\r\n\r\nThe Head of Estates meets the MFHA annually to review the previous season’s activity and to report on any issues and agree any actions that need to be taken. Through the agreements with MFHA and MDBA, the Forestry Commission is able to monitor the conduct of trail hunts on the PFE to ensure hunts comply with legislation.\r\n\r\nThe Government has no plans to ban trail hunting, which is a legitimate activity. Anyone who believes an offence is taking place, or has taken place, during a hunt (including trail hunting) should report the matter to the Police, as they deal with complaints of illegal hunting. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","created_at":"2018-10-17T15:05:28.675Z","updated_at":"2018-10-17T15:05:28.675Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":230451,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/230451.json"},"attributes":{"action":"UK government to integrate all rights in UN CEDAW Convention into domestic law.","background":"In 1986 the UK government ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).

The SEND system introduced through the Children and Families Act 2014 is aimed at identifying and meeting a range of diverse needs. Schools should be monitoring the progress of all their pupils and intervening where learning difficulties are identified, providing ‎the 'graduated approach' known as SEN support. This is a cycle of assessment, planning, intervention and review used by schools and colleges to assist them to identify needs and continuously support progress. Schools and colleges are required to use their best endeavours to support children and young people’s needs. \r\n\r\nWhere this approach is applied in a timely and effective way, the majority of children and young people with autism can and do achieve well in their education without an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plan. In January 2018 14.6% of the school population were identified with SEN and just 2.9% of these had an EHC plan. \r\n\r\nIf a child or young person, including those with autism, does not make expected progress in response to the support being provided by the school, or the support required exceeds the school or colleges’ SEND provision, the school or college, or the parents/carers of the child or young person, or the young person themselves, can ask the local authority to carry out an EHC needs assessment, provided one has not taken place in the previous six months. All local authorities have a duty under the Children and Families Act 2014 to carry out assessments and draw up EHC plans where necessary and they must look at each request for an assessment individually. \r\n\r\nMany children and young people with autism do have an EHC plan. 28.2% of all the pupils with EHC plans in January 2018 had autism identified as their primary need, the most common type of need overall (School Census). Out of 119,909 pupils with a primary need of autism, 55% had an EHC plan (or statement) and 45% were on SEN support.  Identification of children with autism who need plans has increased each year since 2010. Children and young people with autism are being identified for EHC plans where necessary. \r\n\r\nChildren and young people with autism have especially benefitted from the person-centred, multi-agency, participative approach of the reformed SEND system and its focus on good progress and successful supported transition to adulthood. The system is based on meeting individuals’ needs rather than the creating mandatory categories of groups of children with SEND.  \r\n\r\nWe have funded the Autism Education Trust (AET) since 2011 to deliver autism awareness and autism training to education staff in early years, schools and further education settings and it has so far reached more than 190,000 people - not just teachers and teaching assistants, but also support staff such as receptionists, dining hall staff and caretakers, encouraging a ‘whole school’ approach to supporting pupils with autism.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education","created_at":"2018-10-30T09:36:02.329Z","updated_at":"2018-10-30T09:36:02.329Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":223075,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/223075.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Reduce VAT to 5% on repairs and approved alterations to listed buildings.","background":"Private listed property owners are preserving much of Britain’s built heritage for future generations, yet many are struggling to maintain and repair their homes.

Two of the advisers  are registered paralegals and are able to respond to daily questions via the website, emails, phones and legal clinics. www,citizensadvice.org.es","state":"open","signature_count":5173,"created_at":"2018-09-12T19:33:38.810Z","updated_at":"2018-11-19T20:45:48.475Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-09-20T09:50:34.299Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-09-13T16:06:49.416Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Myra Cecilia Azzopardi","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":230140,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/230140.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Raise the Rate: increase the national funding rate for sixth form students","background":"Sixth form funding was subject to deep cuts after 2010 and the national funding rate for 16 and 17 year olds has remained frozen at £4,000 per student, per year since 2013/14.
