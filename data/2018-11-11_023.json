As well as Wembley and other English stadia games could be played at Principality and Hampden Park.","state":"open","signature_count":19,"created_at":"2018-07-17T16:24:32.091Z","updated_at":"2018-10-22T13:03:00.820Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-07-24T10:14:34.365Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-07-17T20:57:35.159Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Richard Overington","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":225167,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/225167.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Set up a Citizens' Assembly for public engagement at Parliament","background":"Public Engagement is seen to be in distress, with a feeling of disconnect and distrust between voters and House of Commons\r\n\r\nWe ask that a representative sample of the electorate is invited with remuneration to engage with issues and MPs at Parliament, and make recommendations on current affairs","additional_details":"Citizens' Assembly Ireland: https://www.citizensassembly.ie/en/\r\n\r\nSortition Foundation: https://www.sortitionfoundation.org/what_is_sortition\r\n\r\nLecture by Prof. James Fishkin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27tVMj6YUNM\r\n\r\nFT article on David Van Reybrouck: https://www.ft.com/content/03f34228-4e72-11e6-8172-e39ecd3b86fc","state":"open","signature_count":19,"created_at":"2018-07-17T11:05:20.581Z","updated_at":"2018-07-25T08:28:47.897Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-07-24T08:43:52.667Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-07-17T11:39:50.109Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Hal Rowlinson","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":225149,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/225149.json"},"attributes":{"action":"No one can become an MP without having worked 15 years in the workplace.","background":"'Career' politicians do not have experience of our lives in the UK.
