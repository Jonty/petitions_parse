Foreign investment in housing has allowed companies to make housing their business by buying/selling \u0026 renting out. This causes house prices and rents to continuously soar and has already made homes unaffordable to middle-class citizens.","additional_details":"Whenever new flats are built some percentage of it goes to council. Then a huge percentage are bought by foreign/local companies. Then whatever flats are left, some of them are bought by people who already have homes. This puts a huge pressure on supply and greatly increases the supply-demand gap that triggers house prices shoot up. Home is a basic necessity as food \u0026 water, and therefore it cannot be allowed to become a business. If Government is not doing enough, then people should be compensated.","state":"open","signature_count":15,"created_at":"2018-08-15T10:10:18.642Z","updated_at":"2018-12-10T11:51:15.744Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-09-07T10:31:07.016Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-08-22T17:57:12.860Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Jubin Chawda","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":227269,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/227269.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Ban the sale of all acid that burns the skin on contact","background":"Today I walked into a discount home store and found acid on sale for £1.99.
