The UK should impose embargo on the nation until democracy has been restored.","state":"open","signature_count":42,"created_at":"2017-09-18T19:56:37.141Z","updated_at":"2017-12-24T20:23:27.166Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-09-19T16:32:06.216Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-09-18T20:31:38.781Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Maurizio Cuttin","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":200555,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200555.json"},"attributes":{"action":"HGVs to be restricted to the slow lane only on motorways and dual carriageways","background":"Due to the increase in serious road traffic accidents cause by HGVs we would like to see HGVs restricted to the slow lane on motorways and dual carriageways","additional_details":"","state":"open","signature_count":42,"created_at":"2017-09-16T19:36:20.455Z","updated_at":"2017-12-24T20:24:22.361Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-09-18T13:58:01.056Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-09-16T20:38:53.857Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Vanessa Turpin","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":200266,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200266.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Double the mandatory sentence for possession of a Firearm","background":"The UK and specifically urban inner city areas are blighted by gun crime.
