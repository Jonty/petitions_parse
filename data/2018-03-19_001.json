The Prime Minister has called modern slavery one of the ‘greatest human rights issues of our time’, and made clear that the international community must step up our efforts to eradicate it.  It is not acceptable that such exploitation is occurring in the 21st Century. \r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister launched a Call to Action to end modern slavery at this year’s UN General Assembly alongside 40 other countries, and committed to doubling UK aid spend in support of this objective to £150 million. We will continue to push for an increased international response, through the UN and other channels, to eliminate these horrific crimes, provide support for victims, and bring criminals to justice. In particular, we are pushing for the United Nations Security Council to take greater steps to combat slavery in conflict situations. \r\n\r\nThe UK Government shares others’ disgust and grave concern at the recent video footage apparently showing slave markets in Libya.  We welcome the Libyan government’s commitment immediately to investigate these reports and to ensure that those involved are brought to justice.   In addition, the UK has raised with the Libyan Prime Minister the importance of offering humanitarian support to migrants.  \r\n\r\nWe have consistently argued for a comprehensive approach, addressing the root causes of migration as well as their consequences.  In addition to the UK’s £150 million commitment on modern slavery, UK programmes have provided humanitarian aid to migrants and refugees, and delivered assistance in detention centres and to those rescued at sea.  We have provided specific support to women and girls, to protect them from the heightened risks of trafficking and sexual and gender based violence.  So far this year, the Department for International Development has supported more than 20,000 emergency interventions such as healthcare, funding psychosocial support, hygiene kits and safe shelter to migrants and refugees in Libya.\r\n\r\nWe have also developed a new £75m migration programme, which will specifically target migrants travelling from West Africa via the Sahel to Libya.  It will provide critical humanitarian assistance and protection and assist those along the way that may wish to return home, providing information about the dangers ahead and offering vulnerable people meaningful alternatives to the treacherous journeys to Libya and Europe.  \r\n\r\nAt the United Nations General Assembly in September, the Prime Minister committed to increasing efforts to tackle smuggling and trafficking through building the capacity of Libyan law enforcement agencies, and supporting efforts to sanction people smugglers at the UN.  \r\n\r\nThe UK has made clear at the United Nations Security Council our condemnation of these reports, and we support the recent Declaration from the EU-Africa Summit and the establishment of an EU-AU-UN Taskforce to address this dire situation to help returns.  UK programming has enabled the assisted voluntary return of over 1,400 migrants from Libya to their home countries this year, and we support further efforts in this area, including by the European Union Emergency Trust Fund for Africa.\r\n\r\nWe are clear that a sustainable improvement in the human rights situation in Libya can only be achieved under the stability of a strong and united Government, and we are actively supporting UN-led efforts to deliver a more inclusive political settlement in Libya.  As well as our support for peace mediation and stability we are providing support to improve women’s rights, civil society, municipalities, and freedom of speech.  A safe, secure and prosperous Libya that is able confidently to tackle the challenges in the region is in all our interests.\r\n\r\nThe Government looks forward to responding with fuller details on this very important issue in the forthcoming Westminster Hall Debate on Monday 18 December.\r\n\r\nForeign and Commonwealth Office","created_at":"2017-12-13T10:52:14.144Z","updated_at":"2017-12-13T10:52:14.144Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":"2017-12-18","transcript_url":"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2017-12-18/debates/D4D9004C-0D4E-4DAD-8C98-309E2C42D2E1/EnslavementOfBlackAfricans(Libya)","video_url":"http://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/71772c45-c2ba-400a-a9f3-7bcdd9400907","debate_pack_url":"http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CDP-2017-0259","overview":""}}},{"type":"petition","id":205106,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/205106.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Stop the privatisation of NHS services","background":"We call for a ban on the outsourcing (privatisation) of NHS services, and stop the renewal of any outsourcing contracts already signed.

Therefore the Government considers that a public inquiry into this tragic case is not necessary.","details":"The murder of Jamie Bulger was an appalling crime which shocked the nation and, 25 years on, continues to be of huge interest and concern. Our deepest sympathies remain with Mrs Fergus and Mr Bulger for the pain and suffering they have endured. \r\n\r\nBecause this case has been of such understandable concern, when the man formerly known as Jon Venables was recalled to custody in February 2010, the then Justice Secretary asked Sir David Omand, the former Permanent Secretary at the Home Office, to conduct an extensive review of the management of Venables from the time of his release from Red Bank Secure Children’s Home in 2001 until his recall to custody. In July 2010 Venables was convicted of possessing, downloading and sharing indecent images of children, and Sir David’s detailed report was published in November 2010 and can be found at the following link: https://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/publications/corporate-reports/MoJ/2010/omand-review-web.pdf \r\n\r\nThe independent Parole Board directed Venables’ re-release on life licence – subject to strict licence conditions in July 2013 after a thorough risk assessment and in accordance with the statutory release test, which is whether it is necessary on the grounds of public protection for the offender to be detained in custody. The Parole Board is legally not allowed to share the reasons behind any of its release decisions, but the Government last month announced an urgent review into how to increase the transparency of Parole-Board decision-making and whether and how it might be possible to challenge those decisions.\r\n\r\nUnlike in 2010, Jon Venables’ recent criminal acts were discovered as a direct result of the tight monitoring to which he was subject by the Police and Probation Services. He has also constantly been subject to stricter licence conditions and more scrutiny than most lifers would be at the same stage of their sentence. For that reason, a review of the management of Venables since 2010 would not have the same clear focus. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, the Government’s number one priority is public safety so we will of course keep the monitoring practice under constant review. Venables is now serving a sentence of 40 months’ imprisonment for possessing indecent images of children. Once he has completed the custodial part of that sentence, he will remain in custody until the independent Parole Board determines that his risk is such that he may be re-released on life licence.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Justice","created_at":"2018-02-14T14:06:36.907Z","updated_at":"2018-02-14T14:06:36.907Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":206722,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/206722.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Call on PM to take action to build public trust in the Grenfell Tower Inquiry","background":"Bereaved families \u0026 survivors call on PM to exercise her powers under the Inquiries Act 2005 to appoint additional panel members with decision making power to sit alongside Chair in Grenfell Tower Inquiry: to ensure those affected have confidence in \u0026 are willing to fully participate in the Inquiry","additional_details":"To secure trust in an establishment we feel has been distant \u0026 unresponsive, \u0026 to avoid a collapse of confidence in the Inquiry's ability to discover the truth, it is fundamental that;\r\n\r\n1.

Section 7 of the Inquiries Act 2005 allows the Minister responsible for an inquiry to appoint further panel members during the course of an inquiry with the agreement of the Chair.\r\n\r\nIn October 2017, the Chair announced the appointment of 7 expert witnesses with backgrounds in fire safety, forensic fire analysis, fire engineering, disaster resilience and also anatomy and human identification. The expert witnesses will provide a range of technical advice and expert reports to assist the work of the Inquiry in delivering its terms of reference.\r\n\r\nIn addition, in November 2017, the Chair announced the appointment of 3 assessors with backgrounds in community engagement and social housing, local authority administration and structural engineering.  The Chair also confirmed at the Inquiry’s preliminary hearing in September that he would expect the assessors to see all the evidence and sit with him when taking oral evidence. The Chair has also confirmed that he may make further appointments if needed.\r\nFollowing the announcement of these appointments, the Prime Minister carefully considered the composition of the Inquiry panel in light of the diversity and expertise of advice now available to the Inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister wrote to the representatives of the survivors and bereaved families on 21 December 2017 and informed them of her decision not to appoint additional panel members. The Prime Minister’s decision was similarly communicated to the Inquiry on the same date.\r\n\r\nHaving regard to the terms of reference and the assistance to be provided by the assessors, and the expert witnesses, it is the Prime Minister’s view that the Inquiry panel has the necessary expertise to undertake the Inquiry as it is currently constituted. The Prime Minister is also conscious of the need for the Inquiry to complete its initial report as quickly as reasonably possible. The Prime Minister therefore considers that additional panel members should not be appointed at this stage.\r\n\r\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Prime Minister fully took into account her duty under section 149 of the Equality Act 2010 (the Public Sector Equality Duty – PSED).\r\n\r\nThe Government recognises the importance of ensuring that those most affected by the tragedy are able to contribute fully to the Inquiry and that is why the Prime Minister welcomes the consideration being given by Sir Martin Moore-Bick to the establishment of a community advisory panel, as proposed at the December procedural hearing.\r\n\r\nSuch a panel, similar to that which has worked well for the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, could play a very beneficial role in putting those most affected at the heart of the Inquiry and enabling them to ensure that their views and experiences are heard. It is for Sir Martin, as Chair of the independent Inquiry, to take this forward, in consultation with the Grenfell Tower community, and the Government hopes that he will be able to do this as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nIn line with the Inquiry Rules 2006, legal representatives of the Grenfell community core participants will receive in advance of hearings disclosure of relevant evidence; will be able to make opening and closing statements at certain hearings and can suggest lines of questioning to be pursued by Counsel to the Inquiry. They can also apply to the Chair to ask questions of a witness.\r\n\r\nCabinet Office","created_at":"2018-01-05T10:15:21.002Z","updated_at":"2018-02-08T09:53:33.016Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":209455,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/209455.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make Orkambi available on the NHS for people with Cystic Fibrosis","background":"Conventional CF treatments target the symptoms of CF, precision medicines like Orkambi tackle the cause of the condition.

NICE’s appraisal committee concluded that while Orkambi was clinically effective and important for managing cystic fibrosis, the benefits were not sufficient to justify its considerable cost. Officials from NHS England engaged with Vertex (the manufacturer) to explore proposals to secure a pricing structure that would enable a positive recommendation from NICE – however, Vertex was unable to come forward with a viable model that would enable the drug to be funded. \r\n \r\nNICE periodically reviews its guidance to determine whether there is significant new evidence that might affect its recommendations.

There is legislation in place that controls the sale, use and misuse of fireworks; we have no plans to extend this further.","details":"The Government takes the issue of firework safety very seriously. There is legislation in place relating to the supply, storage, possession and use and misuse of fireworks. This includes legislation which regulates the supply and use of fireworks, both for the general public and professional display operators. Restrictions on the sale and use of fireworks are set out under the 2003 Fireworks Act, the Fireworks Regulations 2004 and the Pyrotechnic Articles (Safety) Regulations 2015. These contain provisions to minimise the risk of fireworks harming people, property and animals. Although a small minority of people use fireworks in a dangerous, inconsiderate or anti-social manner, we believe that the majority use them sensibly and responsibly.\r\n\r\nThe Government is aware of concerns about the distress noisy fireworks can cause to individuals, as well as to livestock, pets and wildlife. Therefore, the Government urges those using fireworks to be considerate to their neighbours and give sufficient notice of firework use, particularly to those who are vulnerable such as older people, children, those with mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and those with pets and livestock. We have worked with the fireworks industry to encourage users of fireworks to give notice of their displays so that those who are vulnerable or keep animals can make arrangements for their safety.  \r\n\r\nThe Blue Cross animal charity has also produced information on animals and fireworks, which gives advice on how to avoid or reduce stress to animals when fireworks are being set off.  The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) and the Kennel Club provide similar advice on their websites concerning how to minimise the impact of fireworks use on animals.\r\nThere is already a ban on the general public from purchasing fireworks with higher levels of risk and noise and seasonal limitations on their sale. The Fireworks Regulations 2004 restrict their sale to the traditional fireworks periods around 5th November, Diwali, New Year’s Eve and the Chinese New Year. These are an important part of British tradition reflecting our history and multi-culturalism. While it is possible to buy fireworks at other times of the year, a ‘licence to sell fireworks’ is required and strict conditions are imposed outside the traditional periods. \r\n\r\nAt present any firework that exceeds 120 decibels must not be supplied to consumers. There are also low noise fireworks available that consumers can choose to buy, but we do not propose to bring in regulations to require all fireworks to be low noise. \r\n\r\nGovernment acknowledges that many people have genuine concerns about the use and, the misuse, of fireworks and the risks of firework-related injury.

","details":"The UK welcomes genuine visitors to the UK. The visitor route offers a huge range of activities that can be undertaken whilst a person is in the UK, including spending time with family. \r\n\r\nEvery visitor is assessed against the same Immigration Rules regardless of nationality. The only difference is where that assessment is made. Some individuals are assessed overseas by an entry clearance officer, while others are assessed at the UK border. All visitors to the UK are assessed against the Immigration Rules on a case by case basis.\r\n\r\nNationals of some non-EEA countries need a visa to visit the UK. Visas are an important part of securing the UK’s border and are an effective tool for the UK in reducing illegal immigration, tackling organised crime and protecting national security. \r\n\r\nAppendix V to the Immigration Rules sets out the requirements that a person seeking entry to the UK as a visitor must meet. This includes that a visitor must satisfy the decision maker that they are a genuine visitor who intends to leave the UK at the end of their visit and will not live in the UK for extended periods through frequent or successive visits, or make the UK their own home. They must be able to show that they are able to accommodate, support and maintain themselves during their visit without working or accessing public funds. There is flexibility in the rules for visitors to be maintained and accommodated by friends or relatives. \r\n\r\nAutomatically approving visas for a select group of people would mean that important considerations against the Immigration Rules would not be applied consistently and could raise equality concerns. It could lead to discrimination against those who do not have family members in the UK but have just as valid a reason for wishing to visit the UK.\r\n\r\nThere is also a danger of additional complexity in the assessment process around how an individual would prove that they are the family member of a British citizen. There could be unintended consequences that make the application process longer, more difficult and costly.\r\n\r\nThe Government recognises the importance of family ties. In 2015 we simplified the immigration system for people visiting the UK by consolidating the number of visitor routes from fifteen to four and providing shortened, user-friendly Immigration Rules and guidance to make the requirements easier to understand.

Compulsory microchipping introduced in 2016 makes it easier for lost or stolen dogs to be reunited with their owners.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","created_at":"2018-02-27T17:28:30.691Z","updated_at":"2018-02-27T17:28:30.691Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":201443,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/201443.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Ban Driven Grouse Shooting","background":"Mismanagement of UK uplands for Driven Grouse Shooting leads to the illegal killing and persecution of British raptors, including Hen Harriers, Golden Eagles and Peregrine Falcons and causes significant flood risk, water pollution and environmental damage contributing to global climate change.","additional_details":"*Raptors, Foxes, Badgers, Stoats, Hedgehogs and Mountain Hare are killed in their thousands each year \r\n*Draining of peat bog (internationally valuable Carbon storage resource) and burning of heather has been shown to pollute our waterways, increase lowland flooding and cause significant environmental damage, contributing to climate change\r\n*Grouse moorland estates and wealthy landowners have so far received £20m+ in subsidies paid for by the tax payer \r\n*www.BanDrivenGrouseShooting.Wordpress.Com","state":"open","signature_count":37956,"created_at":"2017-09-25T12:09:51.521Z","updated_at":"2018-03-18T23:57:28.570Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-10-02T11:02:08.489Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-09-25T19:04:36.635Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2017-10-27T20:50:08.893Z","government_response_at":"2017-11-17T12:36:04.801Z","debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Gavin Gamble","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"Defra is working with key interested parties to ensure the sustainable management of the uplands, balancing environmental and economic benefits, which includes the role of sustainable grouse shooting.","details":"The government appreciates that many people hold strong views on the issue of driven grouse shooting. The government considers that shooting activities bring many benefits to the rural economy and can in many cases be beneficial for wildlife and habitat conservation. We recognise that it is vital that wildlife and habitats are respected and protected and the law is respected. We will continue work to ensure a sustainable, mutually beneficial relationship between shooting and conservation. We do have concerns that in some limited instances management practices have unwanted consequences for the wider environment.\r\n\r\nPersecution of British raptors and other wildlife\r\n\r\nAll wild birds are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. We have identified raptor persecution as a wildlife crime priority. Each wildlife crime priority has a delivery group to consider what action should be taken, and develop a plan to prevent crime, gather intelligence on offences and enforce against it. The Raptor Persecution Priority Delivery Group (RPPDG) focuses on the golden eagle, goshawk, hen harrier, peregrine, red kite and white-tailed eagle. The group is working on developing tools to help tackle raptor persecution crimes. \r\n\r\nThe National Wildlife Crime Unit, which is part-funded by Defra, monitors and gathers intelligence on illegal activities affecting raptors and assists police forces when required. Despite instances of poisoning and killing of birds of prey, populations of many species, such as the peregrine falcon, red kite and buzzard have increased. We are concerned that with respect to eliminating illegal bird of prey persecution, there are still individuals who continue to commit these crimes. We will work with all stakeholders to try to eradicate these crimes.\r\n\r\nIn particular the government takes the decline in the hen harrier population in England very seriously and is committed to securing its future. In January 2016 the hen harrier sub-group of the Defra led Upland Stakeholder Forum published the Hen Harrier Action Plan to increase the English hen harrier population. It contains six actions which individually can bring benefits for hen harriers, but when combined, underpin each other and have the potential to deliver positive outcomes. \r\n\r\nThe Action Plan was developed with senior representatives from organisations including Natural England, the Moorland Association, the National Gamekeepers’ Organisation, the Game \u0026 Wildlife Conservation Trust, National Parks England and formerly the RSPB. These organisations, led by Natural England, will monitor activities and report annually on progress to the Defra Uplands Stakeholder Forum and the UK Tasking and Co-ordinating group for Wildlife Crime. \r\n\r\nTargeted control of problem species is only one part of a complex mix of factors that can influence populations. Maintaining the balance between biodiversity and the numbers of each species is important. Defra monitors populations of a number of rare or vulnerable species where human intervention is thought to be a contributing factor in their decline, and ensures appropriate action is taken to keep their populations out of danger.   \r\n\r\nSubsidies to grouse moorland estates\r\n\r\nNeither subsidies nor agri-environment payments are paid to farmers to support shooting activities. Agri-environment schemes provide funding to support environmentally beneficial land management, including the management of habitats and work to improve water quality, facilitate carbon capture and protect our historic landscapes. Uplands, including grouse moors, have complex land ownership and tenure arrangements with many areas being designated common land with multiple beneficiaries. Hence, many of the agreements under our schemes result in funding going to grazing tenancies that are critical to the beneficial management of these areas.\r\n\r\nFlood risk, water pollution \u0026 environmental damage\r\n\r\nThe government is aware that the UK uplands have 75% of the world’s remaining heather moorland and about 13% of the world’s blanket bog. 70% of the UK’s drinking water is provided from upland catchments, and tourism brings in an estimated £1.78 billion to England’s upland national parks.  \r\n\r\nThe government recognises that healthy, active peat provides good habitat for grouse as well as numerous environmental benefits and ecosystem services. Natural England is working with landowners of grouse moors within Special Areas of Conservation to develop voluntary agreements, which include vegetation management principles for the various habitats on grouse moors. The government encourages land managers to work closely with Natural England to put voluntary agreements in place for all the benefits they bring to moor owners and to the environment.\r\n\r\nThe government is also working with moor owners and stakeholders to further improve management practices and peat condition, such as through the Blanket Bog Restoration Strategy.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","created_at":"2017-11-17T12:36:04.799Z","updated_at":"2017-11-17T12:36:04.799Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":201145,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/201145.json"},"attributes":{"action":"We must leave the EU completely in March 2019 - No transition period, No delay","background":"Theresa May is betraying the British people who voted to leave the EU by making the UK stay in until 2021 and paying billions of pounds to the EU while we stay.

This compulsory training in a clinical setting makes healthcare students unique in the student population.\r\n\r\nThe NMC provide guidance on the requirement for students to have supernumerary status during clinical placements. The NMC state that “Programme providers must ensure that students are supernumerary during all practice learning. Supernumerary means that the student will not, as part of their programme of preparation, be contracted by any person or body to provide nursing care”.  \r\n\r\nIt is our view that students' completion of high-quality clinical placements is essential to having a well-trained workforce for the NHS. As a result and in addition to the expenses system already in place and run by the higher education student support system, we have made additional funding available for pre-registration nursing, midwifery and allied health profession students with the purpose of maintaining access to clinical placements and other areas associated with compulsory study. \r\n\r\nWe will also provide students with funding for unavoidable costs incurred for temporary accommodation with the purpose of maintaining access to clinical placements and other areas associated with compulsory study. \r\n\r\nThe funding reforms will not change the arrangement of students being supernumerary whilst on clinical placements and they will not be paid for their clinical learning.\r\n\r\nQuality assurance mechanisms should therefore be in place at all placement providers to enable students to provide feedback and raise concerns about their supernumerary status possibly being compromised. \r\n\r\nHealth Education England is currently piloting the Nursing Associate role with 35 pilot sites training 2,000 Nursing Associates.

This will create better connections and more seats for passengers and allow more goods to be moved by rail, which will also help to improve air quality.\r\n\r\nOpening in 2026, the HS2 network will serve towns and cities including London, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield, Crewe, Nottingham, Derby, York and Newcastle, with trains running on to Scotland. By 2033 up to 18 trains an hour will run in both directions, carrying up to 1,100 passengers each. \r\n\r\nHS2 is a major investment but an essential one. HS2’s total budget is £55.7bn. Over the current Spending Review period spending on HS2 will equate to 0.14% of GDP. We are keeping a tough grip on costs and are determined to deliver HS2 on time and on budget.\r\n\r\nBenefits to the North\r\n\r\nWe are delivering unprecedented investment in infrastructure in the North, to redress the historic imbalance in infrastructure investment between north and south. The Northern Powerhouse is a key priority, and our substantial investment will boost the northern economy and reduce the prosperity gap with the South that has existed for far too long.\r\n\r\nWe are also working to future-proof HS2 by including provisions for new junctions in the North and Midlands, which will help ensure that the infrastructure can accommodate the Northern powerhouse. HS2 will transform capacity and connectivity for millions of people across the north. With HS2 stations in Manchester, Leeds, Crewe and Sheffield, the north will be the principal beneficiary of HS2. \r\n\r\nHS2 will underpin the plans of local areas to grow their economies, in places like Leeds where the South Bank regeneration project around Leeds station is expected to support 35,000 jobs across key sectors and 4,000 new homes. HS2 will generate around £25 billion of contracts and represents a major opportunity for businesses across the whole of the UK including small and medium-sized enterprises.\r\n\r\nThe Government has committed £60m to take HS3, or Northern Powerhouse Rail, forward and we are working closely with Transport for the North to develop a business case for the project by the end of 2018. The Government is investing over £13bn in the north of England’s transport infrastructure, including on roads and railways, to deliver faster journeys and increased capacity. That work will continue apace and is a key priority for the Department.\r\n\r\nThis includes dramatically improving journeys for passengers across the north with the Great North Rail Project. By 2020, as a result of this ambitious and comprehensive upgrade, passengers will benefit from faster and more comfortable journeys, as well as new direct services across the north and beyond. We are also developing options for the Transpennine Route Upgrade, to increase the number of seats, and reduce journey times, allowing journeys such as from Leeds to Manchester in 40 minutes. \r\n\r\nHS2 is key to the future of our transport system and the relationship it has with our existing network is a vital part of our planning.  It is not a case of “either/or” but rather one of joined up and complementary delivery.  Over £38 billion is being spent on improving the existing rail network for the five years between 2014 and 2019.  This investment is funding projects to increase capacity on the existing rail network and improve journeys for all passengers. There is also potential for HS2 to increase the amount of freight transported by rail – meaning fewer cars and lorries on our roads, cutting congestion and carbon.\r\n\r\nCreating Jobs and skills\r\n\r\nHS2 will support growth in the wider economy, worth an additional 100,000 jobs. 70% of all jobs created by HS2 will be outside of London. But this isn’t just about when the new railway opens - jobs and skills are being created now. \r\n\r\nSeveral contracts have already been let and major contracts for up to £11.8 billion worth for the civil engineering work will be let this year. HS2 is working with businesses across the UK - including many small and medium-sized firms - to ensure they are well prepared to bid for work on HS2. HS2 will generate around 25,000 jobs during construction as well as 2,000 apprenticeships.\r\n\r\nAnd HS2 is about upskilling: a more skilled workforce is vital for the country as we forge a bold new positive role for ourselves in the world. The National College for High Speed Rail, based in Doncaster and Birmingham, will open its doors later this month. The College will train young people to build HS2 and other world-leading rail projects. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport","created_at":"2017-10-11T16:46:55.405Z","updated_at":"2017-10-11T16:46:55.405Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":211950,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/211950.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Create a new independent welfare body to protect racehorses from abuse and death","background":"The British Horseracing Authority is responsible for race horse welfare.

The Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions 2016 (TSRGD) sets out the design and conditions of use for traffic signs that may be used on roads in England, Scotland and Wales. \r\n\r\nTraffic signs use symbols which enable drivers to take in the information quickly and understand the meaning of the sign. Symbols are often internationally recognised which is important for all road users, especially those who may be unfamiliar to the area. \r\n\r\nIn the case of a directional sign to a leisure facility (such as a football ground), the symbols used are a general representation of the activity being depicted. As such, drivers can then quickly understand the type of destination. The football ground symbol first appeared in TSRGD in 1994 and road users have become accustomed to its use.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of traffic signs is to “convey warnings, information, requirements, restrictions or prohibitions” (Section 64 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984). \r\nThe Department for Transport commissioned research into road user’s understanding of traffic signs in 2011. This concluded that respondents “showed a good basic level of understanding as to what different types of sign meant” and recommended that signs should be kept simple.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of a traffic sign is not to raise public appreciation and awareness of geometry which is better dealt with in other ways. If the correct geometry were put onto a sign, it would only be visible close up and not from the distance at which drivers will see the sign. The detail of the geometry would also not be taken in by most drivers who were merely looking at the sign for direction. The higher level of attention needed to understand the geometry could distract a driver’s view away from the road for longer than necessary which could therefore increase the risk of an incident.\r\n\r\nAdditionally the public funding required to change every football sign nationally would place an unreasonable financial burden on local authorities.

It is London households who pay the additional precept set by the Mayor, which is charged to meet the Mayor’s costs, over and above each London Borough’s council tax bill.

Our vision for care must also incorporate the wider networks of support and services which help older people to live independently, including the crucial role of housing and the interaction with other public services.  It must consider how care is provided at present and challenge the system to embrace new technology, innovation and workforce models which can deliver better quality and value.\r\n\r\nTo deliver a lasting solution, it is right that we take the time needed to debate these complex issues and listen to a range of perspectives to build consensus.  For this reason, over the coming months, we will work with experts, stakeholders, people using care and support services, and carers to shape the long-term reform which is urgently needed.  The Government has already established an Inter-Ministerial Group to oversee development of the Green Paper, and as part of this initial engagement we have asked a number of independent experts in this area to provide their views to the group.  The Government will also engage closely with representatives from local government, the NHS, the voluntary sector and care providers, as well as with people who use care and support and carers, to underpin development of the Green Paper.  And when the Green Paper is published, it will then be subject to a full public consultation, providing a further opportunity for interested parties to give their views.\r\n\r\nWhilst the Green Paper will focus on care for older people, the Government recognises both the challenges faced by people of working age with care needs and the many common questions about the sustainability of the care system.  Many of the discussions on the Green Paper reforms will impact on care and support for adults of all ages.  However, to ensure that issues for working-age adults with care needs are considered in their own right, the Government will take forward a parallel programme of work, led jointly by the Department of Health and the Department for Communities and Local Government, which will focus on this group.

To achieve this, we have established a Rough Sleeping and Homelessness Reduction Taskforce who, with the support of an expert Advisory Panel, will drive forward the implementation of a cross-Government strategy. Enforcement can form part of moving someone away from the streets but it should also come with an offer of meaningful support.  In developing the strategy, the Taskforce and Advisory Panel will consider a range of measures to support rough sleepers off the streets, including enforcement measures where appropriate.\r\n\r\nUnder sections 3 and 4 of the Vagrancy Act 1824, begging and persistent begging in a public place are arrestable offences.  They are also recordable offences which enables the police to identify repeat offenders. Decisions on arrests are an operational matter for the police, in line with their duties to keep the peace, to protect communities, and to prevent the commission of offences, working within the provisions of the legal framework set by Parliament (or, as appropriate, the common law).\r\n\r\nIt is an operational decision for the police following advice from the Crown Prosecution Service, whether or not an offence reaches the threshold required for prosecution under the relevant legislation.\r\n\r\nIf any person whilst begging uses threatening or abusive words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour, within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby then they could be prosecuted for an offence under the Public Order Act 1986 and if convicted are liable to be fined.  There are also a range of offences under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 which are available if violence is used by a beggar.\r\n\r\nThe Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 introduced Public Spaces Protection Orders (PSPO) which place restrictions or impose conditions on activities that people may carry out in a designated area.  These replaced the use of Anti-social Behaviour Orders.  PSPOs should not be used to target people based solely on the fact that someone is homeless or rough sleeping, as this in itself is unlikely to mean that such behaviour is having an unreasonably detrimental effect on the community’s quality of life which justifies the restrictions imposed.  Councils may receive complaints about homeless people, but they should consider whether the use of a PSPO is the appropriate response.  These Orders should be used only to address any specific behaviour that is causing a detrimental effect on the community’s quality of life which is beyond the control of the person concerned. \r\n \r\nCouncils should therefore consider carefully the nature of any potential PSPO that may impact on homeless people and rough sleepers.  It is recommended that any Order defines precisely the specific activity or behaviour that is having the detrimental impact on the community.  Councils should also consider measures that tackle the root causes of the behaviour, such as the provision of public toilets. \r\n \r\nThe council should also consider consulting with national or local homeless charities when considering restrictions or requirements which may impact on homeless people and rough sleepers.\r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2018-02-01T10:05:25.323Z","updated_at":"2018-02-01T10:05:25.323Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":203692,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/203692.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Teach black history In History lessons","background":"Introduce black history into primary and secondary schools","additional_details":"Black history is only taught in some schools and only as and when teachers feel it may be necessary.\r\nWe are asking the goverment to look at this closely to make black history become a part of history studies throughout the year.\r\nAlso looking at ways to have black history as part of GCSE options in secondary schools.","state":"open","signature_count":19223,"created_at":"2017-10-25T15:04:37.622Z","updated_at":"2018-03-18T23:31:50.723Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-11-01T17:54:31.700Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-10-27T14:46:11.351Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2017-11-09T09:58:40.175Z","government_response_at":"2017-11-23T17:48:06.449Z","debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"stephanie pitter","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"The national curriculum gives examples of black history topics, which schools may teach at each key stage.

Personalised support is available and targeted at those that need it most.","details":"The best way to help people out of poverty is to help them into work. Work is the pillar of a strong economy and a strong society and we believe that work should always pay, that we should have a welfare system that helps people into work, supports people who need help, and is fair to those who pay for it. \r\n\r\nThe old system which UC is replacing is complicated, inflexible and involves different agencies and Government departments. This complexity would often mean that people were put off from taking up offers of employment or taking on more hours.\r\n\r\nUniversal Credit is revolutionising the welfare system by making work pay. It simplifies the system and provides a single payment for people in or out of work which ensures that people are always better off working and better off working more. There are none of the cliff edges or complicated hours rules of the old system, just a single, simple, taper so payments reduce in a transparent and predictable way as earnings increase.\r\n\r\nUniversal Credit provides unprecedented level of personalised support. People receive tailored support managed through personal work coaches, who know each person’s case and have more tools than ever before to help people prepare for work and get a job. \r\n\r\nWe know this is having a positive impact on employment outcomes, it’s been proven by three separate research studies. Compared to the old system, people on Universal Credit are more likely to be in work after 6 months, spend more time looking for a job, more time looking to increase their earnings and will actually consider work they wouldn’t have considered doing before.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Government recognises that high childcare costs can affect parents’ decisions to take up paid work or increase their working hours. We increased the level of support for childcare costs within Universal Credit from 70 per cent to 85 per cent. The intention is that families will get more out of the money that they earn, and will find that it pays to get a job, from taking the first step back into work, right up to working full-time.\r\n\r\nWe want to make sure that Universal Credit is fair to claimants and to the taxpayer that funds it, and that support is targeted at those that need it most. Each jobseeker receiving UC takes on a ‘commitment’ or ‘contract' which is the obligation to look for and take on work, and in return receive the benefit payment as planned. This clearly sets out what is expected of jobseekers, the support they get to move into work and the consequences of not adhering to the requirements, which can include sanctions. All requirements that are set are reasonable and achievable for each individual claimant, taking their circumstances into account. \r\n\r\nWe want to ensure that 18 to 21-year-olds do not slip straight into a life on benefits, which is why we are helping young people get the training, skills and experience they need to move into a job and build a career. The change to housing costs support for this group will ensure young people in the benefit system face the same choices as young people who work but may not be able to afford to leave home. We know that personal circumstances will differ so we have worked closely with stakeholders to develop a fair and robust set of exemptions to protect the most vulnerable young people.\r\n\r\nUniversal Credit aims to support all people to participate fully in society, including remaining in or returning to work. Many disabled people want to work but feel the risk of losing their benefits is too great. Part of the design of Universal Credit is to simplify the current provision in legacy benefits so that Universal Credit is simpler to understand and deliver, and less prone to fraud and error. Rather than replicate every aspect of disability provision in the current legacy system, we have removed the complexity of dealing with different rules for seven different disability additions. There will also be transitional protection for those claimants with existing premiums whose circumstances do not change who move over to Universal Credit as part of the managed migration process, if their overall entitlement would be less than under the old system.\r\n\r\nThe Government recognises the importance of self-employment and small businesses to the economy and to society. As part of the Government’s wider growth strategy, we are keen to help self-employed people to achieve their potential and progress in work. We are also keen to support new enterprise and there is a range of support for small businesses such as the new Enterprise Allowance. Universal Credit supports people into self-employment where it is the best route for them to become financially self-sufficient. The aim is to increase the number of people progressing from low earning self-employment and becoming more self-sufficient in the long term and to encourage those reporting very low self-employed income to increase their earnings. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions","created_at":"2017-11-15T10:33:53.482Z","updated_at":"2017-11-15T11:30:18.722Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":201300,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/201300.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Adapt gambling laws to include gambling in video games which targets children.","background":"Many video game companies in recent years have introduced mechanics which are essentially gambling of which are targeted at children and vulnerable adults.

The Gambling Commission, as the regulator for gambling in Great Britain, has powers to regulate online gambling, and is committed to using its powers and expertise to contribute to creating a safer internet. \r\n\r\nThe Gambling Commission released a position paper in March 2017 detailing existing protections in relation to virtual currencies, eSports and social casino gaming. The paper can be found on the Gambling Commission’s website at the following address: http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/PDF/Virtual-currencies-eSports-and-social-casino-gaming.pdf  \r\n\r\nWhere gambling facilities are offered to British consumers using in-game items that can be converted into cash or traded for items of real-world value, then such activities must be licensed by the Gambling Commission and adhere to strict requirements for the protection of children and the vulnerable, which include measures to prevent underage gambling. It is an offence to invite a child to gamble, and where there is a failure to prevent underage gambling, the Commission will take regulatory and/or criminal action. \r\n\r\nWhere the facility exists for players of video games to purchase a key to unlock a bundle containing an unknown quantity and value of in-game items as a prize, and where there are readily accessible opportunities to cash in or exchange those awarded in-game items for money or money’s worth, then these elements of the game are likely to be considered licensable gambling activities. In contrast, where prizes are restricted for use solely within the game, such in-game features would not be licensable gambling. The Gambling Commission is committed to working with the video game industry to prevent gambling-related harm related to their platforms.\r\n\r\nConsumers are also protected by the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008. This includes a requirement on businesses not to subject anyone to misleading or aggressive marketing practices, or, for example, direct exhortation to buy products, such as games content, including in-game purchases such as loot boxes. The government is committed to ensuring that consumers are properly protected and that children’s vulnerability and inexperience is not exploited by aggressive commercial practices.\r\n\r\nThe Video Standards Council (VSC) Rating Board is the designated body for classifying video games, and applies the Europe-wide PEGI ratings to video games supplied in the UK. The PEGI criteria currently make provision for games depicting simulations of traditional gambling, and such games would generally attract a minimum PEGI rating of 12. The VSC Rating Board is discussing these issues with the PEGI Council and its Experts Group to determine whether any changes to the PEGI criteria need to be made.\r\n\r\nThe Gambling Commission monitors the participation of children in gambling through a range of data sources including complaints, academic research and the annual Young People and Gambling Survey, which in 2017 included specific questions in relation to eSports and video gaming. The results of the survey are due to be published soon. The Gambling Commission has also asked the Responsible Gambling Strategy Board to examine the wider relationship between children and gambling. \r\n\r\nOn 11 October the government published the Internet Safety Strategy, setting out plans to make the UK the safest place in the world to be online. The Strategy outlines how the government will work with online platforms, game publishers and game developers, and with agencies such as the VSC Rating Board, to continue to improve online safety in games. This includes promoting further awareness and understanding of PEGI age ratings, parental controls and advice on safe gaming.\r\n\r\nThe government recognises the risks that come from increasing convergence between gambling and video games.

As the Secretary of State set out in his Written Ministerial Statement on 12 December, there was never any question that this government’s policies on animal welfare are driven by the fact that animals are sentient beings. We have published a draft Bill which underlines the government’s commitment to raising animal welfare standards. The draft Animal Welfare (Sentencing and Recognition of Sentience) Bill increases the maximum prison sentence for animal cruelty tenfold to 5 years in prison and clearly recognises animal sentience in domestic law. The Bill also requires UK government Ministers to have regard to the welfare needs of animals when formulating and implementing government policy. We are currently seeking views on the draft Bill.  Anyone who wishes to comment has until 31 January 2018 to do so.  \r\n\r\nArticle 13 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) has not delivered the progress we want to see.

Ultimately, Article 13 has failed to prevent practices across the EU which are cruel and painful to animals. \r\n\r\nIn contrast, here in the UK, we are already improving animal welfare standards without EU input and beyond the scope of Article 13. We are making CCTV mandatory in all slaughterhouses – a requirement which goes above and beyond any EU rule.

The Government recognises that healthy, active peat provides good habitat for grouse as well as numerous environmental benefits and ecosystem services. Natural England is working with landowners of grouse moors within Special Areas of Conservation to develop voluntary agreements, which include vegetation management principles for the various habitats on grouse moors. The Government encourages land managers to work closely with Natural England to put voluntary agreements in place for all the benefits they bring to moor owners and to the environment. \r\n\r\nThe Government is also working with moor owners and stakeholders to further improve management practices and peat condition, such as through the Blanket Bog Restoration Strategy.\r\n\r\nWith regard to birds of prey, like all wild birds they are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.

There are many legitimate, commercial reasons for people to do this and for businesses to engage them in this way. The off-payroll working rules, more commonly known as IR35, have been in place since 2000 to ensure that, where individuals would have been employees if they were providing their services directly, they pay broadly the same tax and National Insurance as other employees. It is fair that two individuals doing the same job in the same way pay broadly the same tax and National Insurance, even if one of them structures their work through a company.\r\n\r\nAs highlighted by reports from the Office of Tax Simplification and the House of Lords, it is clear that IR35 is not effective enough. To improve compliance, the Government introduced reforms in the public sector from April 2017. Individuals working through their own company in the public sector are no longer responsible for operating the off-payroll rules. Instead, where an individual’s company is directly engaged by a public sector body, the public sector body is responsible for determining whether or not the rules apply, and deducting any necessary employment taxes on payments to the individual’s company. Where this engagement takes place through an agency, the public sector body is responsible for determining whether or not the rules apply and informing the agency of this decision, in order that any necessary employment taxes can be deducted by the agency.\r\n\r\nThis is not a new tax on the self-employed. IR35 only applies to those who work like employees and would have been employed were they not working through a company. Genuinely self-employed individuals continue to be unaffected, as has been the case for over 15 years.\r\n\r\nThe Government is monitoring the impact of its reform of IR35 in the public sector. Initial evidence suggests that it has been successful in improving compliance. More people working through their own company are paying the right tax. However, the cost of non-compliance in the private sector is still growing and will cost taxpayers £1.2 billion a year by 2022/23. Therefore, a possible next step would be to extend these reforms to the private sector. \r\n\r\nTo take account of the needs of businesses and individuals who would implement any change, the Government will carefully consult on reform in the private sector, drawing on the experience of the public sector reforms, including through external research due to be published in the new year.\r\n\r\nHM Treasury","created_at":"2017-11-30T14:16:56.274Z","updated_at":"2017-11-30T14:16:56.274Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":200372,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200372.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make it illegal for any UK politician to lie or mislead the public.","background":"We the UK general public are sick to death of politicians that cannot be trusted, too many openly lie to the people and media, then laugh it off when caught out and nothing is ever done.\r\n\r\nWe demand honest representation from politicians to ensure our democracy is protected for the people.","additional_details":"The misconduct in public office offence presents a good starting place for the offence.\r\nhttp://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/l_to_o/misconduct_in_public_office/\r\n\r\n- An elected representative.\r\n- Wilfully lies or deceives the public or news media to such a degree as to amount to an abuse of the public's trust in elected office.\r\n- Will be guilt of the offence.\r\n- Excuses or justification should only function in mitigation of sentence not guilt; a lie is a lie.","state":"open","signature_count":14752,"created_at":"2017-09-15T00:44:15.933Z","updated_at":"2018-03-18T22:55:18.446Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-09-19T16:03:59.252Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-09-15T04:01:18.775Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2017-12-13T13:37:25.530Z","government_response_at":"2018-01-05T10:16:31.489Z","debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Martin Spamer","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"The 7 principles of public life apply to all those who hold public office and form the basis of ethical standards expected of holders of public office as set out in their respective Codes of Conduct.","details":"The seven principles of public life apply to those who hold public office.

Seventy percent of the UK’s drinking water is provided from upland catchments and tourism brings in an estimated £1.78 billion to England’s upland national parks.\r\n\r\nNatural England is working with landowners of grouse moors within special areas of conservation to develop long term land management plans, which include vegetation management principles for the various habitats on grouse moors. The Government encourages land managers to work closely with Natural England to put these plans in place for all the benefits they bring to moor owners and to the environment.\r\n\r\nWith regard to grouse moorland management, grouse shooting is one of the main land uses in the uplands along with grazing and forestry. The Government recognises that healthy, active peat provides good habitat for grouse as well as numerous environmental benefits and ecosystem services. The Government is working with moor owners and stakeholders to further improve management practices and peat condition, such as through the Blanket Bog Restoration Strategy.\r\n\r\nWith regard to birds of prey, like all wild birds they are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The current legislation and guidance balances competing social, economic and environmental interests, while protecting the conservation status and welfare of the relevant bird of prey species. Some species of birds of prey need specific protection because their low numbers indicate that their populations are struggling.\r\n\r\nThe Government takes the decline in the hen harrier population in England very seriously and is committed to securing its future. In January 2016 we published the Hen Harrier Action Plan to increase the English hen harrier population. It contains six actions that individually can bring benefits for hen harriers, but when combined underpin each other and have the potential to deliver positive outcomes. \r\n\r\nThe Action Plan was developed with senior representatives from organisations including Natural England, the Moorland Association, the National Gamekeepers’ Organisation, the Game \u0026 Wildlife Conservation Trust, National Parks England and formerly the RSPB. These organisations, led by Natural England, will monitor activities and report annually on progress to the Defra Uplands Stakeholder Forum and the UK Tasking and Co-ordinating group for Wildlife Crime.\r\n\r\nRaptors, like all wild birds, are afforded protection from illegal killing by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. However, the Government is concerned that there are still individuals who continue to commit these crimes. \r\n\r\nAs a result, the Government has identified the illegal persecution of raptors as a wildlife crime priority. Each wildlife crime priority has a delivery group to consider what action should be taken, and develop a plan to prevent crime, gather intelligence on offences and enforce against it. The Raptor Persecution Priority Delivery Group is made up of representatives from Government and non-government organisations working together to help preserve and protect the six UK priority raptor species (goshawk, red kite, golden eagle, hen harrier, peregrine falcon and white tailed eagle). \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the National Wildlife Crime Unit, which is part-funded by Defra, provides valuable intelligence and operational support to police forces in tackling wildlife crimes, including raptor persecution. There are strong penalties in place to punish those committing offences against birds of prey and other wildlife. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","created_at":"2018-03-08T16:49:57.844Z","updated_at":"2018-03-08T16:49:57.844Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":200952,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200952.json"},"attributes":{"action":"House of Commons vote on whether Brexit should be cancelled.","background":"Brexit was initiated on the basis that it was the 'will of the people' and the Government needed to act on that.

The Government does not intervene in the way that road closures are managed for Remembrance Sunday Parades. ","details":"The Government fully recognises the enormous sacrifices that have been made by British military personnel. Remembrance ceremonies and parades are an important and valued means by which communities across the country honour the sacrifice of British service personnel.\r\n\r\nWe are very sensitive to the pressures the police face. We recognised the importance of wider policing in the 2015 Spending Review, which protected overall police spending in real terms. Also nationally, the police hold over £1.6 billion of financial reserves.\r\n\r\nForces are expected to hold reasonable contingencies in their budgets to cover the costs of policing events, particularly annual ceremonial events such as Remembrance Sunday parades. Additional funding is normally only considered in respect of special events where their policing costs exceed one per cent of a police force’s total funding, or where meeting these costs would place a force at financial risk.\r\n\r\nThere is no Government policy on road closures for Remembrance Sunday Parades and there is no proposal to introduce legislation. It is for the local traffic authority (that is, the council of the relevant county or metropolitan district, not the police) to decide on the road closure or other legally enforceable traffic management measures it considers necessary for the conduct of any local on-road event. These are decisions for which it is responsible to its electorate. \r\n\r\nRoad closures for local Remembrance Sunday Parades are effected through Traffic Regulation Orders made under section 16A of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. Section 16A is used to close roads temporarily for \"sporting events, social events or entertainment\", collectively known as special events. Under section 16A, a local traffic authority can impose temporary highway restrictions for a special event once and for up to three days in any calendar year. \r\n\r\nRestrictions for special events over and above this that affect the same length of road require the consent of the Secretary of State for Transport. Otherwise, the Department for Transport does not get involved and the event remains purely a local matter. Where the Secretary of State’s consent is required, the Department does not impose conditions on the way that the road is to be closed and does not charge the local authority for granting consent. \r\n\r\nAs with any event, decisions on the deployment of resources to police road closures are operational matters for the Chief Constable of the force concerned, in association with Police and Crime Commissioners. The Police have not and do not routinely police Remembrance Parades and are more likely to determine the level of policing required for an event on the basis of an assessment of crime, disorder and public safety. \r\n\r\nThe police’s role is to enforce the general law on road traffic and any special measures introduced for the event in question, such as a local Traffic Regulation Order. They also have a general power to direct traffic. The authority or police may advise the local community on other steps that might be taken and associated measures that might be desirable, such as the taking out of insurance. How the police carry out enforcement is a matter for their discretion.\r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2017-11-08T09:57:36.327Z","updated_at":"2018-01-09T17:19:09.506Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":212467,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/212467.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Set up a public inquiry into the National problem of Paedophile grooming gangs","background":"Paedophile grooming gangs seem endemic nationwide in the UK it is apparent some are possibly racially motivated \u0026 the UK public deserves protection from this and an inquiry should investigate fully if race \u0026 culture is a factor and if sentencing is adequate and investigate if culture influences rape","additional_details":"Rotheram, Luton.
