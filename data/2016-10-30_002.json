Our providers are committed to providing a quality, sensitive and respectful service by conducting fair, accurate and objective assessments. DWP closely and robustly monitors the performance of all our contracted providers.  \r\n\r\nAssessments undertaken by our contracted providers consider the impact a health condition or disability has on an individual, rather than providing a diagnosis or treatment plan and therefore the role undertaken by our contracted healthcare professionals is quite different to the role carried out by a GP. \r\n\r\nAll healthcare professionals undertaking assessments on behalf of DWP are registered practitioners who have also met requirements around training, experience and competence. \r\nTheir approach should allow an individual the time they need to describe the impact of their health condition or disability in their own words. Healthcare professionals adopt a holistic approach, assessing all the evidence available to them, including their clinical knowledge, to provide a report to DWP Decision Makers. The decision maker will then take into consideration all available evidence, including evidence received from the claimant, reports from GPs, hospital doctors and other clinicians in addition to the assessment report, to determine a person’s eligibility for benefit. \r\n\r\nDWP has also put in place an independent audit of assessments to ensure that the advice provided to the Department's decision makers is of suitable quality, fully explained and justified. In addition, there are other safeguards in place to ensure correct decisions are made, such as DWP decision makers being able to ask the provider for clarification or advice or returning the report to the provider if they believe that it does not provide sufficient information for them to make a decision.\r\n\r\nDWP also has a range of other policies and procedures in place to help people that may need additional support and if someone has been identified by us as needing further support, we ensure this information is passed on to our contracted provider, who will also endeavour to provide the appropriate support to meet their needs.\r\n\r\nAssessment providers are continually looking at ways to improve the service they provide and work closely with DWP on initiatives to improve the overall customer experience. \r\n\r\nOur providers take complaints very seriously and will fully investigate all complaints received, obtaining all relevant information to inform a balanced, appropriate and full response. \r\n\r\nIf, at the end of the complaint process, an individual remains dissatisfied with the way in which the Assessment Provider has dealt with their complaint, they can escalate their concerns to the Independent Case Examiner, who provides a free complaints review service to people that want to complain about government organisations.\r\n\r\nWe are confident that we have the right Assessment Providers in place to deliver our health and disability assessments and that we have a strong contract management and operational monitoring regime in place that enables us to robustly monitor the performance of these contracted providers.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions","created_at":"2016-09-13T14:38:51.300Z","updated_at":"2016-09-13T14:38:51.300Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":132687,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/132687.json"},"attributes":{"action":"A referendum to Vote Scotland out of the U.K.","background":"Scotland had their Referendum to be independent.

The latter provides for public service pensions to be uprated at the same time and by the same percentage as the increase in the additional pension provided under the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (SERPS), which has been based on the increase in the CPI since April 2011. Prior to this date the RPI was used rather than the CPI. The underlying purpose of this legislation is to maintain the purchasing power of the additional elements of state retirement pensions and public service pensions. \r\n\r\nThe rationale for the change is as follows:\r\n•\tCPI is the headline measure of inflation used by the Bank of England;\r\n•\tCPI takes better account of how behaviour changes in response to price changes; \r\n•\tCPI also more accurately represents the inflation experience of pensioners and benefit recipients – for example, RPI excludes pensioners who receive a significant proportion of their income from the State (up to 20% of retired households); and\r\n•\tCPI is less volatile – for example, RPI was negative in September 2009 whereas CPI continued to rise.\r\n\r\nThe pension is accrued (or activated) on the basis of current prices.  The uprating of pensions does not apply retrospectively.\r\n\r\nIn response to a legal challenge against this decision the High Court and the Court of Appeal both ruled in the Government's favour, finding that CPI is appropriate for benefits and pensions uprating.\r\n\r\nRPI has also historically experienced periods of negative year on year change, as in 2009 when the uprating of pensions in payment was also frozen.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence","created_at":"2016-05-27T14:26:17.605Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T14:28:05.184Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":136417,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/136417.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Vote on an early General Election before sending Article 50","background":"The public have voted to leave the EU but with little indication of how negotiations will be approached.

The condition is characterised by a slow progression and patients are managed on a case by case basis as symptoms develop. In a small proportion of cases a stem cell transplant is the most appropriate form of treatment. \r\n\r\nNHS England published the criteria used for routine clinical commissioning of stem cell transplants in 2013 which is available at: www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/b04-p-a.pdf. This commissioning policy for stem transplants reflects the professional consensus on the benefit and risk of a transplant for different conditions that was available when the policy was formulated. In the UK this guidance came from the British Society for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation (BSBMT) in the form of best-practice guides for treatment of adults (2012) and children (2011). This guidance is regularly updated to take account of developments in clinical practice. WM was only added to the guidance in September 2013 and therefore NHS England did not include this condition as part of the overall clinical commissioning policy. This means that NHS England does not routinely commission stem cell treatments for WM patients and that funding of stem cell transplants for these patients has involved other funding mechanisms. Over the last few years some patients have received a stem cell transplant to treat WM. In these cases funding may have involved an Individual Funding Request (IFRs) or been directly funded from an NHS trust.\r\n\r\nEach year, NHS England receives proposals for new drugs, medical devices or interventions for use by specialised services in England. NHS England has to make difficult operational decisions on behalf of tax-payers about how to prioritise the funding that is available for new investments. NHS England needs to ensure it focuses resources on those interventions which deliver the best results for patients, taking into account the evidence for clinical benefit and cost. \r\n\r\nProposals are reviewed by the Clinical Priorities Advisory Group (CPAG) that follows a published procedure. A proposal to routinely commission transplant for patients with WM will be considered by CPAG later this year and NHS Trusts will be informed of the outcome. Until that time, clinicians can continue to apply for funding for stem cell transplant for patient with WM where it can be demonstrated that a transplant is the most appropriate treatment option.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2016-10-12T09:08:43.969Z","updated_at":"2016-10-12T09:08:43.969Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":168135,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/168135.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Support Live Music Venues by preventing inappropriate complaints being actioned","background":"In recent years \"New Neighbours\" complaining about music venues have caused many venues to close or cease live music.

This decision was based on there being insufficient numbers of middle grade obstetric doctors to staff the service safely.  The decision means that maternity services at Horton General Hospital will be offered temporarily by a Midwifery-led Unit (MLU), while efforts continue to fill vacant obstetric posts.   This is an emergency, temporary suspension of consultant-led obstetric and gynaecology services in Banbury from October 2016. Substantial and permanent service change would be subject to the four reconfiguration tests. \r\n \r\nWomen who would have attended the Horton General Hospital for an obstetric-led birth will be offered alternative provision at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford. Other aspects of their antenatal and postnatal care will continue to be provided at the Horton General.\r\n \r\nCommunity midwives will continue to provide a home birth service in the Banbury area.  Antenatal clinics and postnatal drop in services and clinics will continue to be provided at the Horton General Hospital.  Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust’s consultant-led obstetric and gynaecology provision and special care baby unit services would shift to being provided solely at the John Radcliffe Hospital.  The Horton General (including its Emergency Department) would otherwise continue to provide its current range of services.   \r\n \r\nOxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the Horton General, has been struggling to fill middle grade obstetric doctor posts at the hospital for several months.  Should recruitment be successful for the middle grade obstetrician posts at the Horton General Hospital between September and October 2016, the trust would anticipate reinstating obstetric services at the Horton General from January 2017, allowing time for recruited staff to start work and for the necessary arrangements for other staff to be made.  If recruitment is not successful in that timescale, recruitment would continue, with potential reinstatement dates moving on by three-month blocks.\r\n \r\nOxfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group (OCCG) advises that it is developing a county wide transformation programme as part of the Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West Sustainability and Transformation Plan (STP) to shape the future of health care.

The suicide rate in England has been increasing since 2007 and suicide is now the biggest killer of men under 50 as well as being a leading cause of death in young people. We published the cross-Government National Suicide Prevention Strategy in 2012, support by £1.5 million for new research to address this issue. The delivery of the strategy is led by the National Suicide Prevention Strategy Advisory Group.  \r\n\r\nThe National Suicide Prevention Strategy identified men as a high risk group for which suicide prevention interventions should be prioritised and identified young people as a group which requires a tailored approach to meet their specific needs. The Department of Health publishes annual progress reports on implementing the strategy.\r\n\r\nTo implement the strategy, the Department of Health works in partnership with other Government Departments as well as other partners such as the Samaritans and provide financial support for the National Suicide Prevention Alliance, which comprises suicide prevention charities and organisations. The National Suicide Prevention Alliance has published a Strategic Framework to support delivery of the national strategy which includes specific work on targeting men and improving help-seeking for men.\r\n\r\nWe have accepted the recommendations of the Five Year Forward View for Mental Health to reduce the national suicide rate by 10 percent by 2020/21 and for every local area to implement local multi-agency suicide prevention plans by 2017. We are also looking at ways in which we can strengthen delivery of the National Strategy and will publish further details later this year. We know that for men the stigma associated with mental health can create a significant barrier for them talking about mental health issues and seeking help. The Department of Health continues to provide financial support to the national Time to Change Programme which seeks to bring about attitudinal change in people towards mental health issues.  To date over 3.5 million people have reported improved attitudes to mental health. Time to Change works with local communities to bring about changes in attitudes at the grass roots and this includes working with children and young people to enable them to become mental health champions.\r\n\r\nPublic Health England is responsible for improving mental health and wellbeing of the general population which it does by working with regional Directors of Public Health, the NHS and local authorities. In line with the recommendation of the Five Year Forward View for Mental Health, Public Health England is developing a National Mental Health Prevention Concordat to work across Government and wide range of statutory and no-statutory sectors to improve mental wellbeing. Improving mental health provision for everyone will take time but this Government is committed to making this happen for everyone, of all ages, in every part of the country.","created_at":"2016-09-28T09:45:20.375Z","updated_at":"2016-09-28T10:08:28.232Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":167608,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/167608.json"},"attributes":{"action":"We ask the Government to reconsider proposed move of Southend A\u0026E to Basildon.","background":"It is proposed to move Southends A \u0026 E Dept to Basildon Hospital.\r\nThis will mean extended drive times as it is about 18 Miles on the shortest route, with traffic on an already overloaded road system even an ambulance with blue lights and siren could take upwards of 30 / 40 minutes for the journey.","additional_details":"Southend is a major short stay holiday centre, with it's own busy airport \u0026 2 extremely busy main line stations serving London and the East End.

It is for NHS commissioners and service providers to work together with patients and the public in bringing forward proposals that will improve the quality and sustainability of healthcare services.  \r\n   \r\nAlthough this is a local responsibility, the Government has set out strengthened criteria that it expects NHS service changes to meet.  Namely, they should have support from commissioners, focus on improving patient outcomes, consider patient choice, and be based on sound clinical evidence. \r\n\r\nTo ensure services across Mid and South Essex are sustainable in the future, the local NHS is reviewing service configuration across the Southend, Basildon and Chelmsford hospital sites, including urgent and emergency care.

","details":"The Government is committed to providing secure, affordable and clean energy, now and for the future. We need to replace our ageing infrastructure with low-carbon, reliable energy sources; and aim to do so through a mix of technologies and energy supplies, diversifying supply and reducing reliance on any one energy source. Keeping the lights on is non-negotiable.\r\n\r\nThe Government is clear that nuclear will be an important part of the future generation mix; a transition to a low carbon economy is key to our long term economic and environmental prosperity and, looking at the full costs to consumers, nuclear is both cost-competitive and low carbon. It is the only proven, large scale, low-carbon technology which provides base load supply. Currently, the UK has eight power stations which generate around 20% of electricity in the UK. Almost all of these existing power stations are due to close by 2030, and it is important we start to take action now to replace these.\r\n\r\nFollowing a review of the Hinkley Point C project, the Government has decided to proceed with the first new nuclear power station for a generation, subject to a number of conditions being accepted. Hinkley Point C will kick start a new era of nuclear power - building on Britain’s strong nuclear legacy – and help ensure the UK benefits from a diverse future energy mix designed to give consumers reliable and affordable low carbon energy. It will provide 7% of Britain’s electricity needs for 60 years. UK-based businesses will benefit from more than 60% of the £18 billion value of the project, and 26,000 jobs and apprenticeships will be created.\r\n\r\nThe Government is already committed to the renewable energy sector where it has a proven track record - nearly £52 billion has been invested since 2010. The average annual investment has more than doubled in the last 5 years, with an average of £9 billion invested each year in UK-based renewables. Annual support for renewable technologies will more than double, to over £10 billion, in 2020-21.\r\n\r\nSince 2010, the UK has more than trebled its renewable electricity capacity. Renewables’ share of generation increased by 6 percentage points on 2014 to a record 25% in 2015. For the first time, renewable sources provided more power over the year than coal. We are on track to comfortably exceed our ambition of delivering 30% of the UK’s electricity from renewables in 2020-21.\r\n  \r\nIn addition:\r\n•\tsolar PV has had rapid deployment over the past 5 years, with over 99% of the UKs capacity deployed since 2010 and almost 40% of the capacity (3.7GW) was installed in 2015\r\n•\tbio energy generation was 30% higher in 2015 compared to 2014\r\n•\toverall, wind generation was 26% higher than in 2014 and installed capacity 7.0% higher\r\n\r\nRenewables, such as wind farms, are intermittent and this is why the Government supports a balanced energy policy comprising a mix of sources, such as gas, nuclear and renewables.  With increased use of renewable energy, intermittency will become more of an issue and it is something we are planning for very carefully. We are seeking to keep energy bills down by not over incentivising technologies under low carbon incentive schemes. Furthermore, we are encouraging industry to drive down development costs, which is why the Contracts for Difference (CfD) strike price reduces over time.\r\n\r\nAs costs continue to fall, we will scale back support from sectors and redirect support to technologies where it is needed most. Onshore wind and solar costs have already fallen and so we have reduced support in those areas.\r\n\r\nThe Government is committed to providing investors with certainty and reducing risks for future investors. We are doing this whilst seeking to control costs that fall on consumers and ensuring that the Government’s other energy policy objectives, particularly on security of supply and climate change, are met.\r\n\r\nThe Government is clear that the transition to a low carbon economy is key to our long term economic and environmental prosperity; nuclear is part of that generation mix. Looking at the full costs to consumers, nuclear is cost-competitive and low carbon. Importantly it can provide continuous power, irrespective of whether the wind is blowing or the sun shining.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Energy \u0026 Industrial Strategy","created_at":"2016-09-28T14:29:09.283Z","updated_at":"2016-09-28T14:29:09.283Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":166711,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/166711.json"},"attributes":{"action":"April's Law","background":"We the undersigned call on the prime minister to make all sex offenders remain on the register for life no matter the crime, for service providers and search engines to be better policed regarding child abuse images and harder sentences on those caught with indecent images of children.","additional_details":"Five-year-old April Jones was murdered by paedophile Mark Bridger after being abducted from outside her home in Machynlleth October 2012.\r\nBefore April's abduction he was looking at child pornography.
