","details":"The UK must have safe, secure and affordable supplies of energy with carbon emissions levels that are consistent with the carbon budgets defined in our Climate Change Act and our international obligations. We believe that gas has a key part to play in meeting these objectives both currently and in the future. Every scenario proposed by the Committee on Climate Change to meet our legally binding carbon reduction commitments includes demand for natural gas.\r\n\r\nIn part as a result of the UK’s diverse range of energy sources, which include natural gas, we have had competitively-priced energy since 1990 whilst reducing carbon emissions across the economy by 49% – a leading performance among developed nations. Gas still meets over a third of our energy demand and can have a long-term role – particularly alongside the development of carbon capture, utilisation and storage –  which is compatible with our climate change targets as we transition to a low carbon economy.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite the welcome improvements in efficiency and innovation from companies operating in the North Sea, the ongoing decline in our offshore gas production has meant that the UK has gone from being a net exporter of gas in 2003 to importing over half (53%) of gas supplies in 2017 and estimates suggest we could be importing 72% of our gas by 2030. Our current import mix, via pipelines from Norway and Continental Europe and LNG terminals that can source gas from around the world, provides us with stable and secure supplies. However, we believe that it is right to utilise our domestic gas and explore further the potential for onshore gas production from shale rock formations in the UK, where it is economically efficient, and where environment impacts are robustly regulated.\r\n\r\nIn the UK, we have been regulating for gas and oil drilling, both onshore and offshore, for decades and have world leading regulations in place to ensure on-site safety, prevent water contamination, and mitigate seismic activity and air pollution.\r\n\r\nOur tough regulatory system provides a comprehensive regime for exploratory activities.  Our position draws on independent reviews by the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering (2012), and Public Health England (2014).  These reports have considered a wide range of evidence and looked at the UK regulatory system, and hydraulic fracturing in the UK context.  The Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering concluded: “the risks can be managed effectively in the UK, if operational best practices are implemented and enforced through regulation.” \r\n\r\nMoreover, the Infrastructure Act (2015) introduced a range of additional safeguards if an operator wishes to carry out hydraulic fracturing, to provide the public with confidence that this industry is being taken forward safely.  These include environmental and planning permits, groundwater monitoring, and the exclusion of protected areas.\r\n\r\nThe UK has an excellent record of protecting our environment, and the Government has been clear that any resources will only be developed in a manner that is safe and environmentally sound.\r\n\r\nThe Government published a Written Ministerial Statement on shale on 17 May 2018, which can be found here: https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2018-05-17/HCWS690/\r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-21T15:32:44.434Z","updated_at":"2018-11-21T15:33:27.445Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":230451,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/230451.json"},"attributes":{"action":"UK government to integrate all rights in UN CEDAW Convention into domestic law.","background":"In 1986 the UK government ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).

Indeed, a number of the Convention’s obligations do not confer rights on people (for example, Article 5) and accordingly, it is neither appropriate nor possible for legislation to address such obligations. We have put in place a combination of policies and legislation to give effect to the UN human rights treaties that the United Kingdom has ratified, including CEDAW. \r\n\r\nWomen and girls’ rights under CEDAW are largely reflected in existing domestic legislation, such as the Equality Act 2010 and the Human Rights Act 1998. As such, we do not agree that domestic legislation needs to incorporate all the provisions of CEDAW. Moreover, were we to do this within the scope of the Equality Act 2010, it would create a hierarchy of rights in terms of sex as compared to other protected characteristics where the equivalent of CEDAW does not exist.\r\n\r\nThe UK acceded to the Optional Protocol to CEDAW on 17 December 2004. The Protocol recognises the competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to receive and consider complaints from individuals or groups within its jurisdiction. It also creates an inquiry procedure enabling the Committee to initiate inquiries into situations of grave or systematic violations of women’s rights. \r\n\r\nIt is clear there is an incredibly broad range of work still to be done. Building on the introduction of our world leading regulations which requires every large employer to publish their gender pay and bonus gaps every year, we will continue to step up our efforts to eliminate the gender pay gap entirely, which is central to growing our economy. \r\n\r\nWe want to have 33 per cent of all board and senior leadership positions, such as board directors, in the FTSE 350 are held by women by 2020 so that young women see women in leadership positions in every part of society.\r\nTo ensure we protect and support victims, recognise the life-long impact domestic abuse can have on children and make sure agencies respond to domestic abuse, we will publish a landmark draft Domestic Abuse Bill later in this parliamentary session.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to work on building a society where gender has no bearing on a person’s pay or opportunity.\r\n\r\nGovernment Equalities Office\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-20T11:28:42.994Z","updated_at":"2018-11-20T11:28:42.994Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":223225,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/223225.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make it a criminal offence to leave animals especially dogs or cats in a hot car","background":"Make it a specific criminal offence to leave a dog, cat or any other living animal in a car especially during hot weather or heatwaves or any other conditions in which the car may become overheated and unbearable for the animal and especially in which may effect the health or be fatal for the animal","additional_details":"I’m wanting this to become a criminal offence after seeing numerous press articles about dogs especially being left in hot cars during the recent hot weather.\r\n\r\nI have some links to some of the recent press articles -\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5891053/Police-called-dog-locked-sweltering-hot-car.html\r\n\r\nhttps://www.somersetlive.co.uk/news/somerset-news/dog-trapped-in-hot-car-1721661\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5887581/Dramatic-moment-police-forced-smash-car-free-two-sweltering-dogs.html?ito=social-facebook\r\n\r\nI hereby call on the government to make it a criminal offence to leave any animals and especially dogs or cats in a car in hot uncomfortable conditions, especially conditions which may affect the health of the animal and/or may be fatal.","state":"open","signature_count":13051,"created_at":"2018-06-27T21:55:03.726Z","updated_at":"2018-12-03T20:27:37.505Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-07-03T15:34:39.394Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-06-27T22:39:58.692Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2018-08-05T17:23:30.291Z","government_response_at":"2018-08-14T11:21:58.517Z","debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"James Jennings","rejection":null,"government_response":{"responded_on":"2018-08-14","summary":"It is already a criminal offence to cause an animal unnecessary suffering by leaving it in a hot car.","details":"It is a criminal offence, under the Animal Welfare Act 2006, to cause an animal unnecessary suffering, including by leaving it in hot car.

A huntsman will go out ahead of the field and lay a trail; the dogs and followers will then follow this trail. Because the huntsmen or followers do not know in advance the route hounds will take when following the trail, trail hunting tends to closely match traditional live quarry hunting.\r\n\r\nIt is for the Forestry Commission to decide whether to permit trail hunting on its land.\r\n  \r\nThe Forestry Commission only permits trail hunting on the Public Forest Estate (PFE) to members of the Masters of Fox Hounds Association (MFHA) and the Masters of Draghounds and Bloodhounds Association (MDBA). The Forestry Commission enters into master agreements with the MFHA and MDBA, which strictly govern the terms under which trail and drag hunting are permitted on the PFE.\r\n\r\nThe agreements oblige each hunt to obtain a separate permission from the Forest Management Director of the District to trail and drag hunt on the PFE and to agree dates and routes four weeks prior to the commencement of the season in November.\r\n\r\nThe permission obliges the hunt to maintain £5 million liability insurance and indemnify the Forestry Commission against any damage or loss. The permission also strictly enforces the byelaws of the Forestry Commission and gives the Forest Management Director the ability to restrict the number of hounds and manner of hunting.\r\n\r\nThe Head of Estates meets the MFHA annually to review the previous season’s activity and to report on any issues and agree any actions that need to be taken. Through the agreements with MFHA and MDBA, the Forestry Commission is able to monitor the conduct of trail hunts on the PFE to ensure hunts comply with legislation.\r\n\r\nThe Government has no plans to ban trail hunting, which is a legitimate activity.

The SEND system introduced through the Children and Families Act 2014 is aimed at identifying and meeting a range of diverse needs. Schools should be monitoring the progress of all their pupils and intervening where learning difficulties are identified, providing ‎the 'graduated approach' known as SEN support. This is a cycle of assessment, planning, intervention and review used by schools and colleges to assist them to identify needs and continuously support progress. Schools and colleges are required to use their best endeavours to support children and young people’s needs. \r\n\r\nWhere this approach is applied in a timely and effective way, the majority of children and young people with autism can and do achieve well in their education without an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plan. In January 2018 14.6% of the school population were identified with SEN and just 2.9% of these had an EHC plan. \r\n\r\nIf a child or young person, including those with autism, does not make expected progress in response to the support being provided by the school, or the support required exceeds the school or colleges’ SEND provision, the school or college, or the parents/carers of the child or young person, or the young person themselves, can ask the local authority to carry out an EHC needs assessment, provided one has not taken place in the previous six months. All local authorities have a duty under the Children and Families Act 2014 to carry out assessments and draw up EHC plans where necessary and they must look at each request for an assessment individually. \r\n\r\nMany children and young people with autism do have an EHC plan. 28.2% of all the pupils with EHC plans in January 2018 had autism identified as their primary need, the most common type of need overall (School Census). Out of 119,909 pupils with a primary need of autism, 55% had an EHC plan (or statement) and 45% were on SEN support.  Identification of children with autism who need plans has increased each year since 2010. Children and young people with autism are being identified for EHC plans where necessary. \r\n\r\nChildren and young people with autism have especially benefitted from the person-centred, multi-agency, participative approach of the reformed SEND system and its focus on good progress and successful supported transition to adulthood. The system is based on meeting individuals’ needs rather than the creating mandatory categories of groups of children with SEND.  \r\n\r\nWe have funded the Autism Education Trust (AET) since 2011 to deliver autism awareness and autism training to education staff in early years, schools and further education settings and it has so far reached more than 190,000 people - not just teachers and teaching assistants, but also support staff such as receptionists, dining hall staff and caretakers, encouraging a ‘whole school’ approach to supporting pupils with autism.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education","created_at":"2018-10-30T09:36:02.329Z","updated_at":"2018-10-30T09:36:02.329Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":223075,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/223075.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Reduce VAT to 5% on repairs and approved alterations to listed buildings.","background":"Private listed property owners are preserving much of Britain’s built heritage for future generations, yet many are struggling to maintain and repair their homes.

The prohibition of some religious groups, and the legal restrictions and harassment aimed at others, undermines freedom of religious belief.\r\n\r\nWe are continuing to monitor reports and gather information about the developing situation, including through conducting official visits to Xinjiang. Ministers and senior officials have been raising our concerns directly with the Chinese authorities for a number of years and will continue to do so.\r\n\r\nThe Foreign Secretary, the Rt Hon Jeremy Hunt MP, raised our concerns about Xinjiang with Chinese State Councillor and Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, during his visit to China in July 2018. The Minister for Asia and the Pacific, the Rt Hon Mark Field MP did likewise with Vice Minister Guo Yezhou during his visit to China earlier that month. Senior officials in London and China regularly raise Xinjiang with their Chinese counterparts. \r\n\r\nIn July 2018, the UK signed the US led Ministerial to Advance Religious Freedom  (https://www.state.gov/j/drl/irf/religiousfreedom/284557.htm)  which highlighted concerns about Xinjiang.\r\n\r\nBritish diplomats in China visit Xinjiang every few months, in order to see at first-hand the situation there. Their observations have supported much of the recent open source reporting about the restrictions targeted at specific ethnic groups.\r\n\r\nDuring China’s Universal Periodic Review (UPR) at the UN on 6 November 2018, the UK asked the Chinese Government the following question about Xinjiang:\r\n\r\n “When will the Government implement the recommendations made by the UN Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) regarding Xinjiang Autonomous Uyghur Region, including to: halt the practice of detaining individuals who have not been lawfully charged, tried, and convicted for a criminal offence in any extra-legal detention facilities; immediately release individuals detained under these circumstances; eliminate travel restrictions that disproportionately affect members of ethnic minorities; and provide statistics on the numbers of those held involuntarily in the past 5 years?”\r\n\r\nIn the UK’s formal statement we recommended that China: “Immediately implement CERD recommendations on Xinjiang and allow the UN to monitor the implementation.”\r\n\r\nFollowing the UPR, Lord Ahmad issued a statement (https://www.gov.uk/government/news/universal-periodic-review-31st-session-minister-for-human-rights-statement)  where he said: “I am very concerned about the human rights situation in Xinjiang, including the re-education camps and the widespread surveillance and restrictions targeted at ethnic minorities, particularly the Uyghurs. The UK and many of our international partners have made clear during China’s UPR that this is a priority issue. We recommended that China should implement CERD recommendations in Xinjiang and allow the UN to monitor implementation.”\r\n\r\nThe UK also supported the statement of 26 October 2018 by the European External Action Service highlighting concerns about Xinjiang. The statement said: “The revision by the Chinese authorities of the \"Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Regulation on De-extremification\" highlights the deteriorating human rights situation in Xinjiang. There are credible reports of mass detentions in political \"re-education camps\" affecting Uighurs and other minorities; of mass surveillance; of restrictions on travel; and of Uighurs abroad allegedly being returned to China involuntarily. These revisions run counter to the recommendations provided by the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which call on China to change its policy in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region. In this context, the EU expects China to respect freedom of religion or belief, and freedom of expression, as well as the rights of persons belonging to ethnic or national minorities, as guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which China is a signatory.”\r\n\r\nAt the 39th session of the UN Human Rights Council in September 2018, we set out our concerns about the situation in Xinjiang and called publicly on China to release those detained for peacefully exercising their rights.\r\n\r\nForeign and Commonwealth Office \r\n","created_at":"2018-11-30T16:25:04.532Z","updated_at":"2018-11-30T16:25:04.532Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":231521,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/231521.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Ban all ISIS members from returning to UK","background":"Ban all ISIS members from returning to the UK, remove their citizenship and passports","additional_details":"By banning all returning ISIS members and by removing their citizenship and passports it would help keep the UK safe from terrorists and their actions.
