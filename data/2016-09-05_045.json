As a small business sole trader I became a victim of fraud losing £4271.39 to a supplier in Holland.\r\n\r\nI wrote to Action fraud, the British police, the Dutch police, the Dutch embassy in London still no one can help, I went to the citizen advice, and even my MP tried to help but dead end. I believe banks should consider and realise how small businesses are affected by fraudsters and chargeback accordingly to exceptional circumstances. It is unbelievable that in such according to my experience no one is helping.","state":"open","signature_count":17,"created_at":"2016-05-19T13:05:34.471Z","updated_at":"2016-08-30T15:09:53.023Z","open_at":"2016-05-23T08:58:19.052Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2016-05-20T16:39:24.577Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"creator_name":"Miss LALA FATUMA TOURAY","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":130841,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/130841.json"},"attributes":{"action":"It is Now time to Abolish Abortions, 200,000 foetus murdered in the UK in 2015.","background":"Since the Abortions were first legalised in 1967, approximately 22,000 abortions were carried out.
