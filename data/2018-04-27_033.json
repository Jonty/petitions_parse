It seems that achieving a Grade D in math at GCSE portrays the idea that we cannot do math. This is absolutely absurd, just because people did not achieve a grade C or above does not mean we cannot do the basic math. I simply believe, to become a teacher within the UK, math should only be a requirement depending on the type of Course the individual would like to teach.","state":"open","signature_count":9,"created_at":"2018-03-22T19:07:42.148Z","updated_at":"2018-04-15T07:53:45.542Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-03-28T09:29:46.854Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-03-22T20:39:27.501Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Kieran Millard","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":215671,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/215671.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Conduct rolling referenda so that the Brexit deal commands support AT THE TIME","background":"Older voters, who were more likely to have died by the time 'Leave' takes effect, tended to favour 'Leave', whilst those under the age of 18, who will live much longer with the consequences, didn't get a vote at all.","additional_details":"The proposal is to conduct a potentially rolling sequence of referenda to ensure that the final outcome from the Brexit negotiations reflects the widest possible support AT THE TIME THE FINAL DEAL COMES INTO EFFECT.\r\n\r\nThere are 4 options. 1.
