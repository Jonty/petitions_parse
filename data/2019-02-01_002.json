Indeed, a number of the Convention’s obligations do not confer rights on people (for example, Article 5) and accordingly, it is neither appropriate nor possible for legislation to address such obligations. We have put in place a combination of policies and legislation to give effect to the UN human rights treaties that the United Kingdom has ratified, including CEDAW. \r\n\r\nWomen and girls’ rights under CEDAW are largely reflected in existing domestic legislation, such as the Equality Act 2010 and the Human Rights Act 1998. As such, we do not agree that domestic legislation needs to incorporate all the provisions of CEDAW. Moreover, were we to do this within the scope of the Equality Act 2010, it would create a hierarchy of rights in terms of sex as compared to other protected characteristics where the equivalent of CEDAW does not exist.\r\n\r\nThe UK acceded to the Optional Protocol to CEDAW on 17 December 2004. The Protocol recognises the competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to receive and consider complaints from individuals or groups within its jurisdiction. It also creates an inquiry procedure enabling the Committee to initiate inquiries into situations of grave or systematic violations of women’s rights. \r\n\r\nIt is clear there is an incredibly broad range of work still to be done. Building on the introduction of our world leading regulations which requires every large employer to publish their gender pay and bonus gaps every year, we will continue to step up our efforts to eliminate the gender pay gap entirely, which is central to growing our economy. \r\n\r\nWe want to have 33 per cent of all board and senior leadership positions, such as board directors, in the FTSE 350 are held by women by 2020 so that young women see women in leadership positions in every part of society.\r\nTo ensure we protect and support victims, recognise the life-long impact domestic abuse can have on children and make sure agencies respond to domestic abuse, we will publish a landmark draft Domestic Abuse Bill later in this parliamentary session.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to work on building a society where gender has no bearing on a person’s pay or opportunity.\r\n\r\nGovernment Equalities Office\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-20T11:28:42.994Z","updated_at":"2018-11-20T11:28:42.994Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":227209,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/227209.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Summon the Dutch ambassador to protest about the “Draw Muhammad” competition.","background":"For a Muslim, the respect and honour of Prophet Muhammad (Peace and Blessings be upon him) is above all else.\r\n \r\n\r\n","additional_details":"The drawing of any cartoon or image of the Blessed Prophet is deeply offensive.

We know what a vital role the sector is playing in making sure people have the skills they need.\r\n\r\nHowever, as with other areas of Departmental spending, 16-19 education funding from 2020 onwards will be considered as part of the next Spending Review.  \r\n\r\nWe are planning to invest nearly £7 billion this academic year to make sure there is a place in education or training, including for apprenticeships, for every 16 to 19 year old.  We have also protected the base rate of funding for all 16 to 19 year old students until 2020 and our commitment to the sector has contributed to the current record high proportion of 16 and 17 year olds who are participating in education or apprenticeships.\r\n\r\nWe are currently delivering a major programme of skills reform and are transforming technical education through the introduction of new T Levels from 2020.  To support the delivery of these new qualifications we will be investing an additional £500m funding per year once the programme is fully rolled out.  We understand that not all providers will be delivering T Levels, however, this does represent a significant investment in our young people and in the 16 to 19 system.\r\n\r\nWhilst we are currently focusing on the introduction of T Levels and reforms to the apprenticeship system, this does not eclipse the crucial importance of the academic curriculum, or the key role FE and sixth form schools and colleges play in delivering this.

However, the Government does take seriously the concerns shared about NHS Trusts allowing commercial representatives to approach new mothers in maternity wards shortly after they have given birth. New parents have a right to dignity and to feel safe and comfortable on NHS wards. This is particularly true for women in the period after giving birth when they may feel especially vulnerable.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) maternity inspection framework was updated to include lines of enquiry about the processes that Trusts have in place regarding the access of commercial representatives on postnatal wards. It is for individual trusts to make decisions about allowing commercial representatives access to postnatal wards.  However, as with all hospital visitors, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) expects trusts to have robust procedures in place to ensure that all representatives respect the privacy and dignity of all women and their families. \r\n\r\nAny commercial representatives speaking to patients within an NHS ward should provide clear information about how patient data will be used and ensure that they are operating in compliance of the Data Protection Act 2018. This is a matter for each individual Trust to consider, in line with their local practices.  Over the last year DHSC has been working alongside system partners within a National General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) Working Group to develop a comprehensive suite of guidance products to help organisations recognise their obligations, and put effective governance and risk management arrangements in place across health and social care. These are published on the NHS Digital website on a dedicated GDPR portal. This website can be accessed via the following link: \r\nhttps://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/looking-after-information/data-security-and-information-governance/information-governance-alliance-iga/general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr-guidance. \r\n\r\nIt is for individual organisations to take account of these guidance products when developing their own policies and risk management practices.\r\n\r\nIpswich hospital has introduced a system where mothers are only approached by a commercial representative if they indicate that this is something that they would like. Mothers can show their preference by placing a card on their bedside table. This is a good example of how Trusts can put processes in place to give new mothers clear control over their interaction with commercial representatives. The Government is considering how to clarify guidance, so that that the interaction between commercial representatives and new mothers on NHS wards is consistently more positive across the UK.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care\r\n","created_at":"2018-10-25T16:10:22.616Z","updated_at":"2018-10-25T16:10:22.616Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":230284,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/230284.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Repeal the EU Withdrawal Act to Prevent Accidental No-deal Brexit","background":"The passing of the EU Withdrawal Act in June 2018 means that by law the UK is set to leave the EU on Exit Day.

It does not dictate the date and time at which we leave the EU. The default date and time of our departure was set when the UK notified the EU of its intention to withdraw under Article 50, which is a matter of international law. \r\n\r\nIf we were to repeal the EU (Withdrawal) Act ahead of our exit from the EU, it would not prevent the UK from leaving the EU, but instead lead to a huge amount of legal uncertainty. The European Communities Act would not be repealed despite the UK having left the EU, and many of the EU laws that businesses and citizens currently live under would not be transferred into our domestic law.\r\n\r\nThe decision to notify our withdrawal under Article 50 was authorised by Parliament through the EU (Notification of Withdrawal) Act, which was approved at Commons Second Reading with a large majority in favour in February 2017. That was, in turn, a response to the 2016 referendum result, in which the British people voted to leave the EU in one of the biggest democratic exercises in the country’s history. \r\n\r\nThe Government’s top priority remains securing Parliamentary approval for the deal we have negotiated with our European partners. That is the best way to deliver on the democratic choice of the British people and the best way to avoid no deal. In this settlement, the UK and the EU have agreed the terms for the UK’s smooth and orderly exit from the EU in the form of the Withdrawal Agreement, and a detailed political declaration on the terms of our future relationship. The Withdrawal Agreement offers a time-limited implementation period that provides a bridge to the future relationship, allowing businesses to continue trading as now until the end of 2020. \r\n\r\nUntil MPs have voted to approve the deal and the Withdrawal Agreement, we will do the responsible thing and prepare for every eventuality, including no deal. The Government has been preparing extensively for a no deal scenario for over two years to ensure that the country operates as smoothly as possible from the day we leave.\r\n\r\nWe have put in place numerous measures to mitigate the potential impact of no deal. For example, we have ensured that critical legislation is in place to ensure legal continuity, agreed key international agreements such as the Nuclear Cooperation deal with the US, Australia and Canada, and we are recruiting hundreds of Border Force officers to keep our border secure.\r\n\r\nWe have also taken steps to communicate to the public how Brexit will affect them and the practical steps that they can take to prepare for it. For example, in the summer of 2018 we published 106 specific technical notices to help businesses, citizens and consumers prepare for March 2019 in the event of a no-deal scenario. More recently, we launched a public information campaign at gov.uk/euexit to give UK citizens, businesses, EU citizens living in the UK and UK nationals living in the EU the latest advice and information on any aspect of Brexit.

","details":"The UK must have safe, secure and affordable supplies of energy with carbon emissions levels that are consistent with the carbon budgets defined in our Climate Change Act and our international obligations. We believe that gas has a key part to play in meeting these objectives both currently and in the future. Every scenario proposed by the Committee on Climate Change to meet our legally binding carbon reduction commitments includes demand for natural gas.\r\n\r\nIn part as a result of the UK’s diverse range of energy sources, which include natural gas, we have had competitively-priced energy since 1990 whilst reducing carbon emissions across the economy by 49% – a leading performance among developed nations. Gas still meets over a third of our energy demand and can have a long-term role – particularly alongside the development of carbon capture, utilisation and storage –  which is compatible with our climate change targets as we transition to a low carbon economy.\r\n\r\nHowever, despite the welcome improvements in efficiency and innovation from companies operating in the North Sea, the ongoing decline in our offshore gas production has meant that the UK has gone from being a net exporter of gas in 2003 to importing over half (53%) of gas supplies in 2017 and estimates suggest we could be importing 72% of our gas by 2030. Our current import mix, via pipelines from Norway and Continental Europe and LNG terminals that can source gas from around the world, provides us with stable and secure supplies. However, we believe that it is right to utilise our domestic gas and explore further the potential for onshore gas production from shale rock formations in the UK, where it is economically efficient, and where environment impacts are robustly regulated.\r\n\r\nIn the UK, we have been regulating for gas and oil drilling, both onshore and offshore, for decades and have world leading regulations in place to ensure on-site safety, prevent water contamination, and mitigate seismic activity and air pollution.\r\n\r\nOur tough regulatory system provides a comprehensive regime for exploratory activities.  Our position draws on independent reviews by the Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering (2012), and Public Health England (2014).  These reports have considered a wide range of evidence and looked at the UK regulatory system, and hydraulic fracturing in the UK context.  The Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering concluded: “the risks can be managed effectively in the UK, if operational best practices are implemented and enforced through regulation.” \r\n\r\nMoreover, the Infrastructure Act (2015) introduced a range of additional safeguards if an operator wishes to carry out hydraulic fracturing, to provide the public with confidence that this industry is being taken forward safely.

Entitlement to State Pension is based on rules at the time of the claim.","details":"The equalisation of State Pension age was introduced against a background of a wide consultation on the policy.\r\n\r\nIn 1995, after 2 years of debate in Parliament and following public consultation, the Government brought in a law to equalise men and women’s State Pension age (SPa). This increased the earliest age when a woman could claim State Pension (SP) from 60 to 65. The Government planned for the original change to take place over 10 years between 2010 and 2020.\r\n\r\nThe Government has gone to significant lengths to communicate SPa changes. Over the last 18 years the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has provided over 25 million personalised State Pension estimates to people who requested them. It has encouraged people to request these as part of their long-term financial planning – after all, retirement is a life changing financial decision and people are expected to plan for this.\r\n\r\nThe equalisation of men and women’s SPa was often reported in the media and debated at length in Parliament. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) produced communications materials relating to increases in State Pension age (SPa) for both men and women, and carried out a pension’s education campaign between 2001 and 2004. This included information on the future equalisation of SPa. Later DWP sent individual letters to those affected. \r\n\r\nBecause of increases in life expectancy the Government needed to make further changes to State Pension age subsequent to Pensions Act 1995 to ensure that the state pension was affordable and sustainable over the long term. In 2007 it introduced a law to increase SPa for everyone to 66 by 2026, to 67 by 2036 and to 68 by 2046. In 2011 it introduced another law to equalise men and women’s SPa more quickly. The 2011 law also brought forward the increase in everyone’s SPa from 65 to 66 by five and a half years.\r\n\r\nThe terms of entitlement to State Pension has to be seen in the context that the State Pension is a Social Security benefit funded through National Insurance contributions.\r\n\r\nThe payment of the State Pension benefit is dependent on reaching the age of eligibility which can be amended through primary legislation. There is no legal contract for the pension between the state and an individual. The National Insurance scheme operates on a 'pay-as-you-go' basis. This means that today’s contributors are paying for today’s social security entitlements and pensions, and those paying contributions previously were paying for the pensioners of that time. In other words, contributors do not accumulate an individual pension fund of actual monies they have paid, which is personal to them. Instead, payment of contributions entitles them or, in certain circumstances, their spouses to a range of social security entitlements which are available on the basis of the rules applicable at the time of the claim.\r\n\r\nWith Government facing increasing financial pressures, it is simply not justified to reverse the policy on State Pension age equalisation. As an example, women who reached State Pension age in 2016 are estimated to receive more State Pension on average over their lifetime than women ever have before.\r\n\r\nWe will be making no further changes to the law on this issue. Doing so would mean working-age people, especially younger people, bearing a greater financial burden to support the rising costs of the pensions system. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions","created_at":"2018-12-20T22:32:55.398Z","updated_at":"2018-12-20T22:32:55.398Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":233408,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/233408.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Review governance of National Insurance Fund","background":"Govt to establish independent review to take control of the National Insurance Fund out of the hands of The Treasury and also for contributors and pensioners to participate in governance of the Fund.","additional_details":"","state":"open","signature_count":12381,"created_at":"2018-11-19T15:02:41.100Z","updated_at":"2019-01-31T23:56:33.087Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-11-26T09:38:37.957Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-11-19T15:41:30.901Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2019-01-29T09:46:36.109Z","government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Joanne Welch","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":229243,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/229243.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Amend the 1967 Forestry Act to protect endangered wildlife habitat across the UK","background":"Under the Forestry Act, in Scotland licences to fell woodland can be refused to protect endangered forest wildlife or granted with conditions to safeguard animals.

","details":"Forestry is a devolved matter; in England the control of tree felling is the responsibility of the Forestry Commissioners under their powers in Part II of the Forestry Act 1967 (as amended). In most circumstances a landowner will require a felling licence from the Forestry Commission before they can legally fell their trees. When considering a felling licence application, the Commission will judge the proposals against the UK Forestry Standard, the government’s approach to sustainable forestry. This standard encompasses the impacts on biodiversity and recognises the importance of priority habitats and species, including red squirrels. Applicants for a felling licence are therefore required to evidence how they propose to manage the impact of felling on wildlife. The Forestry Commission checks all applications against a large number of records, including Red Squirrel Reserves. This allows the Forestry Commission to highlight any potential issues and advise the applicant how to avoid the disturbance or damage of protected species.\r\n\r\nThe Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 makes it an offence to intentionally kill, injure or disturb a red squirrel or intentionally or recklessly damage any place a red squirrel uses for shelter or protection and a felling licence does not remove this responsibility. There is a defence if a person can show that the act was the incidental result of a lawful operation and could not reasonably have been avoided, but this would require them to demonstrate that they had followed good practice and taken all reasonable steps to avoid the disturbance or damage. The need to do this is brought to an applicant’s attention in a covering letter when they are issued with a felling licence.\r\n\r\nWhere other species are affected that are European Protected Species, the defence of an incidental result of a lawful operation does not apply and the landowner must carry out an assessment of the possible impact on protected species and, if necessary, apply for a licence from Natural England. \r\n\r\nWhere proposed tree felling sites carry statutory designations to protect important features, such as biodiversity, the Forestry Commission is required to consult other relevant authorities and seek their agreement as to the appropriateness of any tree felling. This consultation may result in additional advisory notes being applied to a felling licence. Any additional permissions or consents that may be required may also be generated at that time, for example, SSSI consent from Natural England.\r\n\r\nWe will be consulting on an English Tree Strategy later this year.

Together these existing exemptions mean that around 90% of NHS prescriptions are currently dispensed free of charge.\r\n\r\nSickle cell anaemia is not currently listed as a qualifying medical condition for the purposes of help with health costs. Professor Sir Ian Gilmore undertook a review into extending exemptions to all those with long-term conditions, which was published in 2010. At this time, a decision was taken that no changes would be made in light of the financial challenges facing the country. This remains the position and the Government has no current plans to amend the list of medical conditions that provide exemption from NHS prescription charges.\r\n\r\nPeople with sickle cell anaemia may be eligible for one of the non-medical prescription charge exemptions and it is recommended they check. For convenience an eligibility checker tool is available on the NHS Business Services Authority’s (BSA) website at: \r\nhttps://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/check-for-help-paying-nhs-costs/start. \r\n\r\nThis tool has been widely publicised by the nationwide ‘check before you tick’ campaign, launched by NHS England and the NHS Business Services Authority (NHS BSA) to help people understand their eligibility for free NHS prescriptions.\r\n\r\nIn addition, people on low incomes can apply for help with their health costs through the NHS Low Income Scheme. The Scheme provides income related help to people who are not automatically exempt from NHS prescription charges but who may be entitled to full or partial help if they have a low income and savings below a defined limit. Further information, including on how to apply, is available on the NHS BSA’s website at: \r\nwww.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/nhs-low-income-scheme. \r\n\r\nThose people who are not eligible for help with health costs, yet have a high-level or long-term need for prescription medication, may be able to save money by purchasing a prescription prepayment certificate (PPC). These allow people to obtain as many prescriptions as they need for a set cost: £29.10 for a 3-month PPC and £104 for a 12-month PPC. In addition, people can spread the cost of a 12-month PPC by paying through 10 monthly direct debit payments. The NHS BSA actively prepares, circulates and promotes information for on Prescription Prepayment Certificates as part of its duties in administering this service.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care","created_at":"2019-01-22T16:34:58.449Z","updated_at":"2019-01-22T16:34:58.449Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":228362,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/228362.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Urgent law to extend voting rights to British abroad by repealing 15-year rule.","background":"Pass Bill to benefit overseas electors before any further EU vote or general election. 2022 will be too late.

To this end, the Government is supporting Glyn Davies MP's Private Members Bill, the Overseas Electors Bill, which would introduce votes for life for UK nationals living abroad. \r\n\r\nAs well as removing the time limit on the right to vote for UK nationals living abroad, the Overseas Electors Bill would enfranchise any UK national overseas who was previously resident or registered to vote in the UK. At present, only those UK nationals who were registered to vote before leaving the UK may apply to become overseas electors.\r\n\r\nThe Bill passed its Committee stage in the House of Commons in November 2018 and the remaining stages will be scheduled soon.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Government has been clear that we will not hold a second referendum on leaving the Europe Union. A clear majority of those who voted in the 2016 European Union referendum voted to leave the EU. We must respect both the will of the British people, and the democratic process which delivered this result.\r\n\r\nThere are no set rules about who can vote in a nationwide referendum in the UK. Instead, the franchise for each referendum is determined by the legislation for the referendum on a case by case basis.\r\n\r\nThe franchise for the referendum in 2016 was determined by the European Union Referendum Act 2015. The terms of the franchise set out in the Act were scrutinised and debated in Parliament during its passage and agreed by both Houses. In line with the franchise for UK Parliamentary elections, before any reform such as the Overseas Elections Bill, British citizens who had been resident overseas for less than 15 years and had previously registered to vote in the UK were permitted to vote in the referendum.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister has been clear that safeguarding the rights of EU citizens living in the UK and UK nationals living in the EU was her first priority for negotiations. The agreement reached and set out in the Withdrawal Agreement text will provide them with certainty about their rights going forward. It will allow EU citizens in the UK and UK nationals in the EU to continue living their lives broadly as they do now in the countries where they now live. It will enable families who have built their lives together in the EU and UK to stay together. It also gives the people more certainty about residence, healthcare, pensions and other benefits.\r\n\r\nDuring the implementation period, EU citizens coming to the UK and UK nationals going to the EU will be able to live, work and study as they do now. The Government also agreed in March 2018 that we will extend the agreement to those that arrive during the implementation period. Individuals who want to stay beyond the end of the implementation period will have to apply for leave to remain in the UK by June 2021.\r\n\r\nCabinet Office","created_at":"2019-01-31T17:57:17.347Z","updated_at":"2019-01-31T17:57:17.347Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":226109,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/226109.json"},"attributes":{"action":"An independent study to find if driven grouse shooting is of  economic benefit.","background":"Driven grouse shooting is a minority sport which seriously compromises other activities and businesses over vast stretches of northern England.
