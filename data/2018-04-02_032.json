These poor dogs are then left to starve, abandoned, murdered, sold for dissection purposes and worse.","state":"open","signature_count":13,"created_at":"2018-01-31T14:38:58.461Z","updated_at":"2018-03-18T17:59:05.140Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-02-06T17:22:35.062Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-02-01T16:36:19.156Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Kirsty Hughes","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":209813,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/209813.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Naturalisation fees should be reduced significantly, especially for refugees.","background":"Paying fees for Naturalisation or Citizenship, became a nightmare for all people and especially refugees.
