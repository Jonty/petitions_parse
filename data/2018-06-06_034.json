Working hands-on with members of our community would deepen our understanding of our society and revolutionize the role we feel we play in it. An elevated feeling of responsibly towards our society will prove imperative to its success.","state":"open","signature_count":8,"created_at":"2018-03-02T16:41:37.818Z","updated_at":"2018-03-30T02:38:37.618Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-03-08T14:11:33.392Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-03-03T14:05:26.485Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Annika Heath","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":213992,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/213992.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Hold a Northern Ireland referendum on whether to Remain in the EU Customs Union","background":"Northern Ireland voted by a significant majority to Remain in the EU and will be one of the regions most significantly affected by withdrawal.
