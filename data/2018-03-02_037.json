The main problem with this system is that the characteristics which are deemed to be ‘good’ are generally characteristics which people with learning difficulties, such as ADHD or Aspergers will never display under the circumstances of a video interview. In an actual face to face interview, the interviewer can understand and account for the difference in communication while an algorithm cannot.","state":"open","signature_count":6,"created_at":"2018-02-06T21:09:55.626Z","updated_at":"2018-02-13T17:20:20.405Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-02-13T17:20:20.401Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-02-07T14:07:30.672Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Kyle Ablett","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":211830,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/211830.json"},"attributes":{"action":"I believe that every adult in the UK should pay £10 a month to the NHS.","background":"I have been admitted into hospital twice in 5 years for 2 major life changing operations.
