This costs taxpayers' money, some of which goes to private providers, and increases pressure on our NHS, which is already under huge strain. 2012 figures suggest that the NHS may spend over £800,000 a week on “repeat” abortions. That is the hidden cost of abortion. The Government must invest more in educating people to avoid unwanted pregnancies and provide better support for young mothers and single mothers.
