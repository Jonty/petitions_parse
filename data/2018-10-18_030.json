As parents and carers we have a duty to our children.\r\n\r\nThe petition is aimed to try to implement a law that states that no child under the age of 13 should be left alone at any given time, the reason for this is due to safeguarding and putting a huge responsibility on children regardless of their mental age. We are not allowed to leave children alone overnight and the same rules must apply throughout the day too. I understand a child must be given due responsibility but under the age of 13 should not be allowed due to risks and safety.","state":"open","signature_count":9,"created_at":"2018-10-05T21:03:06.130Z","updated_at":"2018-10-15T16:14:06.145Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-10-15T16:14:06.141Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-10-06T17:14:18.947Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Paul Hulse","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":229699,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/229699.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Routinely arm all UK Police Officers.","background":"The British Police face numerous threats including terrorists, robbers, drug dealers, in addition to the growing numbers teenagers who now regularly carry knives.\r\n\r\nThese individuals have no fear, do not value life and would not think twice about shooting or stabbing an unarmed Police Officer.","additional_details":"","state":"open","signature_count":9,"created_at":"2018-10-02T17:59:14.278Z","updated_at":"2018-10-16T15:00:16.495Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-10-11T13:45:13.704Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-10-05T01:17:40.039Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Paul Higgs","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":229649,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/229649.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make cyclists have a registration plate, tax, Mot and insurance","background":"We have been getting very heated with each other over push bikers.
