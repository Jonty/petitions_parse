I work hard and save to take my children to see different places in the world, my son is 9yrs old he is now keen to go on to study geography. His dream is to visit every continent before he is 21. I would like to help him with this dream but it is difficult without getting myself into debt, incurring fines and/or the stigma that is forced upon parents like me because of the current regulations.","state":"open","signature_count":54,"created_at":"2016-02-16T20:52:28.310Z","updated_at":"2016-07-15T15:34:41.234Z","open_at":"2016-02-17T14:28:37.772Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2016-02-16T23:51:10.037Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"creator_name":"Sarah White","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":156832,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/156832.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Provide funding for a specialist music teacher in every primary school.","background":"The racism and xenophobia surrounding the EU Referendum has demonstrated the need for better music education in our schools in order to teach our children about other cultures, create safe spaces where children feel a sense of well-being, joy, togetherness and purpose.\r\n","additional_details":"Primary schools often don't have a specialist; budgets are squeezed.
