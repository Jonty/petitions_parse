The text will get through.","state":"open","signature_count":29,"created_at":"2018-04-08T11:24:47.572Z","updated_at":"2018-05-21T22:27:43.014Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-04-16T16:02:06.862Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-04-10T06:32:47.466Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Malcolm Edward Sweetlove","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":216731,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/216731.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Increase the defence budget to strengthen and build up the UK's Armed Forces.","background":"The UK needs to strengthen and build up it's Armed Forces in order to be able to counter any threat to the Nation and to better its capabilities as a part of NATO.","additional_details":"","state":"open","signature_count":29,"created_at":"2018-04-03T18:46:33.572Z","updated_at":"2018-06-06T17:57:52.303Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-04-09T17:45:15.511Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-04-03T21:18:32.232Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Sam Hilder","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":213168,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/213168.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Govt take action to protect UK citizens in Kerala regarding elephant parades","background":"Every year UK citizens visit Kerala to watch religious ceremonies exploiting captive elephants.
