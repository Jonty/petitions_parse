Porn sites wont necessarily have the proper security. VPN, Tor Browser, proxy search or a torrent make age verification pointless with easy work arounds. Tor Browsers could lead to young people accessing content that is banned/illegal in the UK such as rape \u0026 child pornography videos on the dark web.
