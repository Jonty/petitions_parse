People who are raped using an object or fingers are said to have been 'assaulted by penetration' and not raped.","additional_details":"Using 'assault by penetration' to legally describe this act of rape downplays the experiences of people who have suffered in this way, and could prevent them from getting the support they need from rape shelters and therapy. It could cause additional psychological harm by preventing them from coming to terms with what happened to them, since 'assault by penetration' does not have the same stigma as the word 'rape'. So-called 'assault by penetration' can also cause PTSD, as can rape and other forms of sexual assault. The definition is also too simplistic as it does not take into account lack of consent in LGBT+ interactions and relationships, and implies that only men can rape.","state":"open","signature_count":8,"created_at":"2017-09-18T10:16:12.177Z","updated_at":"2017-09-21T16:15:13.790Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-09-19T13:59:24.266Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-09-19T07:51:10.160Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Amber Mott","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":200986,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200986.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Abolish tuition fees","background":"Charging students for a near-essential requirement for future employment is discouraging even the best and brightest students from furthering their education and achieving their full potential, leaving students in £36,000+ of debt before even starting work.
