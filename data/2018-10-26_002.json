No decisions have been made yet over the share of funds to be allocated to lung diseases, however NHS England has highlighted respiratory healthcare as one of its main priorities to be included in the plan.\r\n\r\nPulmonary fibrosis (PF) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are incurable types of interstitial lung disease (ILD) for which there are few treatment options. NHS England publishes a service specification for ILDs to encourage clinicians to refer patients to their nearest ILD centre for the appropriate investigations and treatment. \r\n\r\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) also publishes guidelines and quality standards for IPF to help healthcare professionals diagnose the condition and provide effective treatment. There are only two licenced disease-modifying drugs available for IPF – pirfenidone and nintedanib. Both of these drugs are approved by NICE and are prescribed by the ILD centres. \r\n\r\nOther types of treatment such as rehabilitation, nursing support, home oxygen, and palliative care, are set out in the ILD service specification to make clear the standards of care expected from NHS providers. \r\n\r\nNHS England also funds the Respiratory Futures programme hosted by the British Thoracic Society (BTS).
