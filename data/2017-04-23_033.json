The very day i started this petition, i had been yelled at by a customer for requesting ID in order to ensure i could process the sale of Vodka. DVDs, Video Games, Fireworks, Knives. NO ID = NO SALE means the cashier is no longer at risk, has confidence to check ID without fear of intimidation and consequence,  put's the onus on the customer to ensure they have ID. This simple change would help prevent under age sales, knife crime, and give everyone confidence in the system.","state":"open","signature_count":29,"created_at":"2016-12-10T11:37:10.485Z","updated_at":"2017-03-20T20:48:49.631Z","open_at":"2016-12-16T12:34:57.626Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2016-12-11T11:16:51.996Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"creator_name":"Jonathon Harris","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":172379,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/172379.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make tattoo discrimination illegal","background":"Tattoo discrimination, especially in the work place, should be made illegal, judge people by their talent, not by looks","additional_details":"","state":"open","signature_count":29,"created_at":"2016-11-13T12:42:06.145Z","updated_at":"2017-04-03T20:13:52.877Z","open_at":"2016-11-17T16:18:09.980Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2016-11-13T13:07:18.369Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"creator_name":"Alan thompson","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":171382,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/171382.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Ban cropping/clipping of a dog's ears","background":"Ban the cropping/clipping of a dogs ears, unless it's for medical reasons.
