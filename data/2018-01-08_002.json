In areas identified as especially high risk, such as the hard shoulder on motorways, the Department for Transport placed a specific responsibility on Highways England, under the Infrastructure Act 2015, to have due regard to the need to protect and improve the safety of the strategic road network as a whole for all road users. This includes ensuring that roadside vehicle recovery operations are safe for both recovery drivers and all other road users. \r\n\r\nAs a first step towards this goal, the Government set a challenging target. Highways England has a target to reduce those killed or seriously injured on their strategic road network, of a decrease of at least 40% by the end of 2020 against the 2005-09 average baselines. Further details on Highways England’s Health \u0026 Safety 5 year plan is available on the Highways England website: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/highways-england-health-and-safety.\r\n\r\nRules 219 and 281 of the Highway Code provide for emergency and incident support vehicles and their corresponding warning signs or flashing lights. These rules advise drivers to be aware of emergency or incident support vehicles on the road: it provides advice on which warning lights or signals these vehicles use, and advises drivers to exercise extra care and attention including slowing down, being prepared to stop, and to follow any directions given by police officers, or traffic officers, as to whether drivers can safely pass an incident or blockage.\r\n\r\nWhether on the strategic road network or on local roads, the police already have powers to deal with road users who do not slow down or move over for vehicles that have broken down or been involved in accidents on the roadside. Road users, are required to comply with road traffic law in the interests of their own safety and that of other road users. If road users do not adopt a responsible attitude, or if their use of the highway creates an unsafe environment or causes a nuisance, they may be committing a number of offences. For example, under sections 2 and 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (as amended) a person may be charged with the offences of dangerous driving, or careless and inconsiderate driving. In each case it is for the police to enforce the law.\r\n\r\nThe Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 also requires employers to ensure the safety of their employees during the course of their work. HSE would expect that employers have arrangements in place to ensure that safe working procedures are used, vehicles and equipment of an appropriate standard are provided and maintained, where necessary, appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) is provided and used, and all persons have been adequately trained by a competent person on how to work safely at the roadside and the precautions they should be recommending to the occupants of incident support vehicles. For further details please visit the Health and Safety Executive website: http://www.hse.gov.uk/foi/internalops/sims/manuf/3_04_61.htm.\r\n\r\nAdvice on safe systems of work for ensuring the health and safety of both roadside technicians and members of the public who may be affected by their activities, has been published in the British Standard Code of Practice, BS 7121-12:1999 “Safe use of cranes - Part 12: Recovery vehicles and equipment - Code of Practice”; and the British Standards Institute (BSI) publication PAS43 “Safe working of vehicle breakdown and recovery operators: Management system specification”. This guidance on the safe management of vehicle breakdown and recovery operations was produced by SURVIVE. SURVIVE is a partnership between the Government, police, motoring industry and service organisations. Its aim is to improve the safety of roadside recovery operators and customers and is currently consulting with interested bodies on procedures for 'breakdowns in coned-off areas'.

We are making Relationships Education in primary schools, and Relationship and Sex Education (RSE) in secondary schools mandatory, and we expect the associated guidance to cover issues such as, respect, friendships, cyber-bullying and staying safe online. We have recently launched a call for evidence to gather the views of teachers, parents, and young people to help us shape relationships education and RSE.\r\n\r\nLaws are already in place to protect people when any form of bullying behaviour constitutes a criminal offence. This includes some types of harassing or threatening behaviour, or communications which can be a criminal offence, for example under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, the Malicious Communications Act 1988, the Communications Act 2003, and the Public Order Act 1986. \r\n\r\nIf school staff feel that a criminal offence may have been committed they should seek assistance from the police who take decisions on whether to investigate or prosecute. Police forces are operationally independent of Government and it is their chief officers who determine the resources allocated to particular priorities.

","details":"The Government is committed to supporting children, young people and adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and improving their quality of life. We recognise the importance for people with ADHD of receiving a timely diagnosis and appropriate support. Current legislation and guidelines set out how services should support people of all ages with ADHD. \r\n\r\nIn 2016, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published a guideline on diagnosing and managing ADHD for people aged 3 and above. This aims to improve the diagnosis of ADHD as well as the quality of care and support for people with an ADHD diagnosis. An updated guideline is expected to be published in February 2018.\r\n\r\nThe Care Act 2014 represents the most comprehensive reform of social care legislation in over 60 years. The Act puts in place requirements for local authorities to meet a person’s eligible care and support needs, including those of people with ADHD, and to help and protect people with care and support needs, who may be at risk of abuse or neglect as a result of those needs. \r\n\r\nThe Government recognises that children and young people with ADHD often need special educational provision and under the Children and Families Act (2014), local authorities, health and care services must commission services jointly to ensure the needs of children and young people with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) are met. Local Authorities must publish a clear outline of services available which has been developed for, and with, parents and young people. \r\n\r\nWe have also introduced a more streamlined assessment process to develop Education, Health and Care plans to support children and young people with SEND. These are co-ordinated across education, health and care, and involve children and young people and their families throughout the process.\r\n\r\nThese measures aim to reduce health inequalities and improve outcomes for children and young people with SEND and their families.  \r\n\r\nWe recognise that having ADHD can lead people to experience mental health problems and the Government is committed to improving mental health support and services. We have increased funding for mental health services by 8.4% since 2014/15 and last year, spend was the highest ever at £11.6bn.  \r\n\r\nWe have also commissioned NICE and the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health (NCCMH) to improve mental health service pathways and tackle variations in provision. NHS England’s ‘Standard for Mental Health Investment’ ensures that NHS investment in mental health increases year on year. \r\n\r\nThe Government has introduced the Children and Young People’s Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme (CYP IAPT) which aims to improve Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). 90% of the 0-18 population are covered by this change programme and we are on course to reach 100% by 2018. \r\n\r\nWhilst we recognise the need to continue to improve support for people with ADHD, we believe the existing statutory framework provides the scope to achieve this and have no current plans to introduce a specific Act of Parliament. \r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2017-12-04T16:21:37.912Z","updated_at":"2017-12-04T16:21:37.912Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":200968,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200968.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Union Jack to appear on British number plates after March 2019.","background":"Why is this important?

This loophole allows unscrupulous thieves to identify themselves as the owners thus depriving the true owners of their treasured pets. Kennel Club figures for 2014 show 70,000 animals missing/stolen and Direct Line figures for 2015/16 show cat theft up by 40% and the true numbers of thefts nearer 360,000. Only 10% of cats were retrieved by microchip which in large part is due to the inconsistency of scanning newly registered animals.","state":"open","signature_count":3491,"created_at":"2017-09-24T20:39:48.865Z","updated_at":"2018-01-07T21:53:55.118Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-10-02T13:43:11.943Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-09-25T19:20:20.030Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Rona Fraoch Little","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":200061,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200061.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Resolve the inequity/inconsistency refunding for NHS trainees under WAT schemes","background":"The WAT scheme introduced to assists NHS workers improve their knowledge on a qualifying WAT course, any payments received was to be exempt from Income tax and NI'.
