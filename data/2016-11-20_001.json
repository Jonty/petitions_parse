Legislation restricts the sale of fireworks and controls their use, and we have no plans to extend this further.","details":"The government recognises the concerns raised about the use of fireworks by the public, particularly the potential distress caused by the use of noisy fireworks to pets, livestock and the public, and injuries caused by accidents and the misuse of fireworks.\r\n\r\nMany individuals enjoy being able to hold private fireworks displays at home, and have a sensible and responsible attitude to their use.  Indeed, the majority of the public who use fireworks do so in a safe and considerate way; it is only an anti-social minority that uses them dangerously and inconsiderately. \r\n\r\nWhile members of the public can hold private firework displays at any time of the year, they are subject to strict curfews which prevent fireworks being used after 11pm, except on a limited number of specific nights of the year around the traditional celebrations of 5th November, New Year, Chinese New Year and Diwali when they can be used up to midnight (5th November) or 1am (New Year, Chinese New Year and Diwali). \r\n\r\nRetailers are restricted to selling fireworks for limited periods around these four traditional occasions, unless they have a valid licence specifically allowing all year round sales.\r\n\r\nThere is maximum noise level of 120 decibels on fireworks sold to the public, and local authorities have powers to deal with excessive firework noise.  There is also a prohibition on setting off fireworks in a public place, enforceable by the police with tough sanctions for non-compliance.\r\n\r\nThere is government-sponsored advice and guidance to support the responsible and considerate use of fireworks on the Safer Fireworks website.  \r\n\r\nWhile any firework-related injury is a cause for concern, the number of injuries are significantly lower than suggested.  Furthermore, the latest official statistics, demonstrate that there is a downward trend in hospital admissions in England (arising from the discharge of fireworks) with 28% decrease between 2010 and 2014/15, when there were 114 admissions.\r\n\r\nThe government will continue to focus on reducing accidents and nuisance by encouraging industry, retailers and others to promote responsible use through guidance and public education.  We urge those using fireworks to be considerate to their neighbours and give sufficient notice of firework use, particularly where they are proposing to let off fireworks in the vicinity of animals, especially livestock, where they should notify owners of livestock nearby of their plans.\r\n\r\nThe government considers these controls effectively manage and reduce the level of risk posed by the public use of fireworks, and that to bring in further restrictions would be detrimental to an important British tradition reflecting our history and multi-culturalism.  There are no plans at the moment to place further limitations on their use.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy ","created_at":"2016-11-14T11:25:55.088Z","updated_at":"2016-11-14T11:25:55.088Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":null,"transcript_url":"","video_url":"","overview":"The Petitions Committee has decided not to schedule a debate on this petition.

But Higher Education and Further Education must remain affordable to the taxpayer. Our approach is based on the fundamental principle that a borrower’s contribution to the cost of their education should be linked to their ability to pay. Graduates generally benefit from higher earnings than those who do not go to university, and we must maintain a fair balance between taxpayers and graduates in the costs of Higher Education. \r\n\r\nGraduates don’t have to repay their loans until they are earning above the annual threshold of £21,000. This threshold remains higher in real terms than that applicable to student loans taken out before 2012. Repayments are then made at a rate of 9% above this threshold. If a borrower earns less than the threshold then no repayments need to be made.

Evidence tells us that they shape children’s future development; influence how well children do at school; their on-going health and wellbeing; and their achievements later in life. It helps to promote a child’s physical, emotional, cognitive and social development. \r\n \r\nThis Government believes that no child should be held back in life because of their background. We want to support everybody to go as far as their talents will take them. Participation in early education at age two delivers greater benefits to disadvantaged children than early education at age three or four, but this group are less likely to access formal early education than their more affluent peers. The early learning for two-year-olds programme is therefore intended to help close this unfair gap. The two-year-old entitlement is in place to close the attainment gap between the most disadvantaged and their better off peers, rather than to act as a work incentive. \r\n\r\nHowever we do clearly understand the impact the cost of childcare can have on parents, and that’s why we are supporting parents with high childcare costs and investing in childcare at record levels. Total government spend on childcare support will increase from £5 billion in 2015-16 to over £6 billion by 2019-20. We are spending this on the current free 15 hours a week for three and four-year-olds and the most disadvantaged two-year-olds; the early years pupil premium for disadvantaged three- and four-year-olds, as well as providing 30 hours of free childcare for working parents of three- and four-year-olds from September 2017. \r\n \r\nWe are also introducing Tax-Free Childcare, which, from early 2017, will save around 2 million families up to £2,000 per child on their annual childcare bill for children aged under 12 (or £4,000 for children with special educational needs or disabilities up to the age of 17). In addition, the childcare element of Universal Credit provides up to 70% of eligible childcare costs (to a maximum limit of £532.29 for one child and £912.50 for two or more children). For parents in receipt of Universal Credit this rose to 85% of eligible costs from April 2016, with the maximum limits increasing to £646.35 for one child and £1108.04 for two or more children.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education","created_at":"2016-11-01T09:34:37.643Z","updated_at":"2016-11-01T09:34:37.643Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":133618,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/133618.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Invoke Article 50 of The Lisbon Treaty immediately.","background":"The British people have spoken.

We recognise and are grateful for the bravery and skills shown by police dogs and their handlers day in and day out.\r\n\r\nThe Government agrees that attacks of any sort on police dogs or horses are unacceptable and should be dealt with severely under the criminal law. The law already allows for significant penalties to be issued to those who attack animals that support the police. An attack on a police dog or other police support animal can be treated as causing unnecessary suffering to an animal under section 4 of the Animal Welfare Act 2006. The maximum penalty is 6 months’ imprisonment, or an unlimited fine, or both. The financial element of the penalty was raised only last year from a maximum fine of £20,000. An attack on a police animal could be considered by the court as an aggravating factor leading to a higher sentence within the available range. Under some circumstances assaults on support animals could be treated as criminal damage which would allow for penalties of up to 10 years’ imprisonment.  \r\n\r\nAn additional offence dealing specifically with attacks on police animals or a move to change their legal status is unnecessary in light of the maximum penalties already in place.  An additional and separate offence may not result in more prosecutions, or increased sentences.\r\n\r\nWhen sentencing for offences of cruelty to or neglect of animals it is for the courts to decide on an appropriate penalty based on the individual circumstances of each case.  Magistrates are provided with guidelines by the Sentencing Council to help them impose appropriate sentences and penalties. The guidelines give examples of offences, aggravating and mitigating factors, as well as the range of suggested sentences and penalties for various types of offences.\r\n\r\nThe Government will continue to work with the police to understand the extent of this problem.  Officials will be meeting national policing leads for police animals to discuss this issue over the coming weeks.

","details":"Bovine TB is the greatest animal health threat to the UK. Dealing with this dreadful disease is costing taxpayers over £100 million each year and last year alone more than 28,000 cattle had to be slaughtered in England, causing devastation and distress for farmers and rural communities, where often herds have often been built up over many generations.   \r\n\r\nThat is why it is essential that we eradicate bovine TB.  \r\n\r\nWe are taking strong action to deliver a long-term plan to eradicate the disease and protect the future of the UK’s dairy and beef industries, with a comprehensive strategy including tighter cattle testing and movement controls, improving biosecurity on farm and when trading, and badger control in areas where badgers are an important factor in spreading disease to cattle.   \r\n\r\nThis approach is backed up by the evidence and experience of other countries. This approach has successfully eradicated bovine TB in Australia and is working in Ireland and New Zealand.  \r\n\r\nThere is still a long way to go. While cattle controls can have a significant impact, the Government’s Chief Veterinary Officer and the British Veterinary Association agree that we won’t eradicate the disease without dealing with the spread of TB from infected wildlife too.   \r\n\r\nThere is broad scientific consensus that badgers are implicated in the spread of TB in cattle in parts of England. \r\n\r\nTB was first found in English badgers in 1971. In 1974 badgers were removed from a severely infected cattle farm with the result that there were no herd TB outbreaks there for five years. Between 1975 and 1978 the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food funded work that demonstrated conclusively that there is a link between TB in badgers and cattle. Subsequent work in Ireland has reaffirmed that finding.\r\n\r\nThe Krebs Review observed that between 1975 and 1979 when gassing was used to remove badgers, cattle TB incidence in the South-West fell from 1.65% to 0.4%, a 75% reduction. Subsequently, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, more widespread badger removal was carried out in three areas. In Thornbury, Gloucestershire, cattle TB incidence fell from 5.6% in the ten years before badger removal to 0.45% in the fifteen years afterwards, a reduction of 90%. In Steeple Leaze, Dorset, there were no herd TB outbreaks for seven years after badgers were removed. In Hartland, Devon, cattle TB incidence dropped from 15% in 1984 to just 4% in 1985, a reduction of more than two thirds.\r\n\r\nFollowing concerns that those exercises lacked rigorous scientific ‘controls’ the government commissioned the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT). Despite the challenge of the Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak, the RBCT showed that in the four years after proactive badger removal there was a significant reduction in cattle TB incidence relative to control areas. The greatest relative reduction seen was 54% in the eighteen months after proactive badger removal operations, when the full benefits began to appear. The RBCT confirmed what the previous exercises had shown.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicensed badger control operations led by local farmers and landowners in parts of Gloucestershire, Somerset and Dorset have shown that it is safe, humane and effective in reducing the number of badgers needed to bring down disease levels in cattle.  \r\n\r\nBased on the advice of the Chief Veterinary Officer, we are extending this approach over a wider area to bring greater disease control benefits to hard-pressed farmers in the South West. \r\n\r\nWe have also funded licensed private badger vaccination projects to help create a buffer zone around the South-West where TB is most widespread. However TB vaccination does not provide complete protection and it has no impact on infected badgers so it cannot replace culling and a shortage of the vaccine means it’s not an option right now.  \r\n\r\nTo ensure we have a successful and resilient industry, we are determined to use all available measures necessary to eradicate this devastating disease as quickly as possible.   \r\n\r\nWe will continue to deliver on our 25-year strategy for a TB-free England. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","created_at":"2016-09-21T14:25:14.646Z","updated_at":"2016-09-21T14:25:14.646Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":168127,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/168127.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Demand an end to the pay restraint imposed on agenda for change NHS staff.","background":"Agenda for change staff including nursing, midwifery, healthcare assistants and associated healthcare professionals have suffered a pay restraint since 2010.

","details":"NHS staff are our greatest asset. Despite the pressures on the NHS driven by an increasingly aged and frail population, nurses, and all our hard working NHS staff continue to put patients first, keeping them safe whilst providing the high quality care patients and their families expect.\r\n\r\nThe Government has protected NHS front line funding whilst increasing staffing levels with over 3,500 more nurses and midwives employed since May 2010 and over 51,000 nurses currently in training.\r\n\r\nHealth Education England, NHS England and the Department have taken a range of actions to boost the supply of domestically trained staff and to increase the efficiency and productivity of the existing workforce.  The NHS is already recruiting more home-grown nurses, promoting return to practice programmes and improving retention of existing staff. For example, an additional £5 million will support the Return to Practice scheme, aimed at encouraging and supporting experienced nurses who have left the profession to return. More than 2,300 returners have been on the programme, with over 700 now back in employment. Reforms to the funding of pre-registration nurse education will enable universities to significantly expand training places by the end of the parliament.\r\n\r\nThe Government greatly values the important work that Agenda for Change (AfC) staff do in delivering essential public services and it is crucial that the public sector continues to recruit, retain and motivate the highest quality staff. In responding to the 2013 Francis Enquiry into the appalling events at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, it was right that trusts wanted to ensure they had the right number of nurses to provide safe quality care. The demand for nurses was much higher than planned, but nearly three years on,  trusts cannot either provide safe quality care or balance their books; they must do both.\r\n\r\nThere is a trade-off between pay and jobs in many public services, and pay restraint is one of the many difficult choices the Government has had to make.  At Summer Budget 2015, the Government announced that it will fund public sector workforces for an average pay award of 1 percent for four years from 2016/2017.  The Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that this policy will protect 200,000 public sector jobs. Whilst pay restraint is challenging, CPI inflation has been at historic low levels, currently 0.6%. Overall earnings for nurses and other non-medical staff have increased year-on-year since 2010/11, in total by 4.0% or 0.8% a year. Average basic pay per full time equivalent has increased by more than the impact of annual pay awards.\r\n\r\nAverage earnings for qualified nurses were £31,214 in the 12 months to June 2016, a slight increase from the same time last year and above the £31,189 figure for the NHS as a whole, which remains well above the national average salary for 2015 of £27,500 a year.\r\nFor nurses and midwives employed in the NHS between March 2010 and March 2015, average total earnings (adjusted for changes in contracted hours) increased by 2.2% a year.\r\n\r\nThe NHS is one of few public sector workforces that receive incremental pay. Around half of AfC staff receive incremental pay of around 3% on average.  A typical qualified nurse (Band 5) can expect seven years of pay progression averaging around 3.8% a year, in addition to annual pay awards.\r\n\r\nWe know pay is not the only reason nurses and other health workers choose a career in the NHS. The reward package also includes a valued pension scheme and other non-pay benefits. Members of the pension scheme can generally expect to receive around £3 to £6 in pension benefits value for every £1 they contribute, while flexible working patterns help staff better manage their personal commitments.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate that housing and travel costs in London can be a barrier to recruiting and retaining the nurses and other key workers the NHS needs.  The reward package for AfC staff that work in and around London includes High Cost Area Supplements:\r\n•\t20% of basic salary, subject to a minimum payment of £4,158 and a maximum payment of £6,405 for staff that work in ‘inner’ London;\r\n•\t15% of basic salary subject to a minimum payment of £3,518 and a maximum payment of £4,483 for ‘outer’ London; and\r\n•\t5% of basic salary, subject to a minimum payment of £961and a maximum payment of £1,665 for the London ‘fringe’.\r\n\r\nThe Department is also considering how best to take account of the housing requirements for NHS staff, particularly in high-cost areas to support permanent staffing.\r\n\r\nThe 2015 NHS Staff Survey shows that for nurses and midwives morale and motivation has improved since 2014. It is critical that the NHS continues to work hard on its staff engagement strategies. We want the NHS to be a place where nurses want to work, where poor care, poor behaviour, bullying and harassment is not tolerated. We know there is a strong link between the reduction in patient standardised mortality rates and organisations with high staff engagement.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2016-11-11T13:59:50.754Z","updated_at":"2016-11-11T13:59:50.754Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":150516,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/150516.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make Eid a National Holiday","background":"Make Eid a National Holiday so that British Muslims do not have to use their annual leave or provide them with the option of swapping Christmas day for Eid holiday.","additional_details":"","state":"open","signature_count":51634,"created_at":"2016-06-27T12:22:49.703Z","updated_at":"2016-11-19T22:28:34.892Z","open_at":"2016-06-28T09:10:26.902Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":"2016-07-14T09:28:19.956Z","scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2016-06-27T15:04:48.433Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2016-06-30T13:31:14.123Z","creator_name":"Moshinur choudhury ","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"The Government has no plans to create another public holiday, or to vary the existing arrangements.

There are currently opportunities for young people to engage with political issues and develop political understanding both through the curriculum and through school life more broadly.\r\n\r\nWithin the curriculum, citizenship has been a compulsory subject in maintained schools since 2002. The programmes of study are designed to prepare pupils to play a full and active part in society, and are organised around core knowledge about democracy, government, and how laws are made and upheld. Citizenship education should equip pupils with the knowledge to explore political and social issues critically, to weigh evidence, debate and make reasoned arguments. Schools have the freedom to decide how they wish to teach the citizenship curriculum to meet the needs of all their pupils. At Key Stage 4, Citizenship Studies GCSE requires students to know and understand the meaning of democracy, how parliamentary democracy operates within the constituent parts of the UK and how government works. Students should also know and understand the relationship between the state and citizens; the rights, responsibilities and duties of citizens living and working in the UK; and how people participate in democracy.\r\n\r\nOther subjects include content that helps to engage young people with political issues. We have reformed history GCSEs, which now have a much stronger emphasis on British history. Within this, there is scope for pupils to study key events such as the origins and evolution of Parliament and parliamentary democracy, Magna Carta, and extensions of the franchise. Pupils can also learn about rights and responsibilities as part of personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) education, a non-statutory subject that can encompass many areas of study. At AS and A level students are able to study politics, where students are expected to develop a broad understanding of the historical development of government and politics in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe government is also taking action in a range of other areas to prepare young people for adult life in modern Britain. We are expanding the National Citizen Service, which promotes cohesion, empathy and positive sharing of ideas.

Once a patient has been diagnosed with diabetes, it is vital to ensure they can manage their condition as effectively as possible.\r\n\r\nNHS England is working with other organisations to help promote services that are integrated around patients’ needs across all settings; and is implementing a 'customer service platform' to allow patients with diabetes to self-manage through booking their own  appointments, managing their prescriptions, monitoring the care they have received and being able to view their personal health records.\r\n\r\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is the independent body that provides guidance on the prevention and treatment of ill health and the promotion of good health and social care. NICE’s guidance is based on a thorough assessment of the available evidence and is developed through wide consultation with stakeholders.\r\n\r\nIn August 2015, NICE published guidelines which recommend that such devices should not be made routinely available to people with Type 1 diabetes unless they are willing to commit to using them at least 70% of the time and to calibrate them as needed (as well as meeting certain other criteria).  NICE’s guideline on the diagnosis and management Type 1 diabetes in adults (NG17) is available at: www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng18. \r\n\r\nNICE will next consider updating this guidance in 2 years’ time. In the meantime, NICE is considering setting up a standing update committee for diabetes, which would enable a more rapid update of discrete areas of the diabetes guidelines, as and when new relevant evidence is published. NICE will confirm whether it is proceeding with this in due course.\r\n\r\nIt is for NHS commissioners to decide whether to make continuous glucose monitoring devices available to their local populations, taking NICE’s guidance into account.\r\n\r\nAs one way of incentivising improvements to diabetes services, NHS England has introduced the Best Practice Tariff for paediatric diabetes which provides an annual payment for the treatment of every child and young person under the age of 19 with diabetes, providing 13 standards of care are met.\r\n\r\nOne of these standards is to ensure that each young person has received a structured education programme, tailored to their and their family’s needs, both at the time of initial diagnosis and ongoing updates throughout their attendance at the paediatric diabetes clinic. \r\n\r\nThe CCG Improvement and Assessment Framework measures progress being made by CCGs in improving outcomes. It includes measures on: \r\n•\tthe proportion of diabetes patients that have achieved all the NICE-recommended treatment targets. (The treatment targets include having HbA1c levels within recommended limits. HbA1c is a measure of patients’ blood glucose levels) and:  \r\n•\tthe proportion of people with diabetes diagnosed less than a year who attend a structured education course. \r\n\r\nTaken together, these should help identify both whether patients are being supported to understand how to manage their blood glucose levels and whether the approaches being taken in a CCG area are successfully achieving improvements in this.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2016-10-07T09:46:31.353Z","updated_at":"2016-10-07T09:46:31.353Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":170006,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/170006.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Set up Independent Pump-Watch body to monitor and regulate vehicle fuel pricing","background":"You may be surprised to learn that how much we pay to fill up our cars vans and trucks isn’t regulated at all.

However, concern was expressed by some that the use of planning conditions to require archaeological excavations would be curtailed by the Bill.   This interpretation does not accurately represent the Government’s intention.\r\n\r\nThe proposed power is to help address the urgent need to tackle the overuse of ‘pre-commencement’ conditions which prevent development, including new homes, from starting until the local planning authority has approved certain details.  The measure will not restrict the ability of local planning authorities to propose conditions that are necessary. In the unlikely event that an applicant refuses to accept a necessary pre-commencement condition proposed by a local planning authority, the authority can refuse planning permission. This will maintain appropriate protections for important matters such as heritage, as well as human health, the natural environment, green spaces, and measures to mitigate the risk of flooding. \r\n\r\nWe are not proposing that all pre-commencement conditions are removed; only that they are used proportionately and provide the applicant with an opportunity to agree to them before they are attached to planning permission.  The process envisaged by the Government is that the local planning authority will notify applicants of any proposed pre-commencement conditions before the determination of an application.  Most applicants are already aware of likely conditions through early engagement with the authority, at which point they can challenge any pre-commencement conditions which may be unnecessary or can be fulfilled at a later date (i.e. during build); ensuring construction can go ahead without delay.\r\n \r\nThe National Planning Policy Framework remains unchanged in that it requires “developers to record and advance understanding of the significance of any heritage assets to be lost (wholly or in part) in a manner proportionate to their importance and the impact, and to make this evidence (and any archive generated) publicly accessible.”\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the Government values the petition in highlighting the importance of archaeology and the historic environment as a material consideration in the planning process, and will continue to engage fully with the sector during the passage of the Bill and beyond. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Communities and Local Government","created_at":"2016-06-07T15:25:42.063Z","updated_at":"2016-06-07T15:25:42.063Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":165674,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/165674.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make Everolimus available in England for TSC-related Brain (SEGA) tumours.","background":"After a 4 year delay, in June 2016, NHS England decided that saving the lives of children and young adults with inoperable TSC-related brain tumours was \"unaffordable\" -  even though the drug (everolimus) would cost the NHS less per patient than kidney dialysis.

It has been managing the clinical prioritisation process for specialised commissioning which considered the cost/benefit of everolimus for SEGA relative to a number of other treatments being considered for prioritisation this year. \r\n\r\nIn July 2016, NHS England set out the results of its annual process for deciding which new treatments and services it will make available to patients. These decisions were however provisional and subject to the outcome of a judicial review relating to NHS England’s commissioning power in relation to a different unrelated treatment.\r\n\r\nOn 2 August 2016, following the judgment being delivered on the outstanding judicial review, NHS England announced that it would, subject to the outcome of an appeal, be re-running its prioritisation process to include those policies that were previously prioritised in levels 3, 4 and 5.  Full details of NHS England’s announcement are available at: www.england.nhs.uk/2016/08/august-update-on-the-commissioning-and-provision-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-prep-for-hiv-prevention/. \r\n\r\nBefore the prioritisation process is re-run there will be a further opportunity for pharmaceutical companies, including Novartis (the manufacturer of everolimus), to offer better prices which would increase the likelihood of treatments being given a higher priority.  However if everolimus to treat SEGA remains at its current priority level of 5 then it will be considered again next year in the prioritisation process for 2017/18, taking into account any new evidence that may have emerged in that time.  The re-run of the prioritisation process is expected to take place at the end of October with final decisions being made in November 2016.  NHS England recognises the need to streamline decision-making and is considering how it can improve the balance between proper consideration of a new treatment, and pace.\r\n\r\nAlthough everolimus for SEGA is not being routinely funded by the NHS, the Individual Funding Request (IFR) route remains open to clinicians for patients with exceptional need. This enables clinicians, on behalf of their patients, to make an application for funding to NHS England for treatments that it does not routinely commission.  Demonstration of clinical exceptionality is a threshold criterion that needs to be met before funding can be considered.  That is, an IFR can only be considered if the patient can be demonstrated to be clinically exceptional compared to the wider group of patients and is likely to derive greater benefit from the treatment.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2016-09-13T16:15:03.848Z","updated_at":"2016-09-13T16:15:03.848Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":167168,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/167168.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Begin a public inquiry into the performance of the Northbound Dartford Crossing.","background":"Road users \u0026 hauliers have been suffering the incompetence of the 'new \u0026 improved' northbound Dartford River Crossing for too long.

Nevertheless, demand for the Crossing is increasing. \r\nHE is working with partners to reduce the impact of incidents on journey times and ensure that the Crossing, the motorway approaches, and the connections with local routes on both sides of the Crossing work as well as they can. The government has no plans to launch a public inquiry into the performance of the northbound Crossing. However, we are closely monitoring conditions at the Crossing and will use the data we are collecting to understand how various factors are contributing to its performance. \r\n\r\nThrough its plans for a new Lower Thames Crossing the Government has a clear long term approach to increase capacity in the area and improve journeys. A consultation on a new Lower Thames Crossing took place earlier this year and a decision on the preferred route is due shortly. In the short term HE is working with partners to do all that is possible to improve traffic flow on the northbound approaches to the Dartford Crossing. \r\n\r\n‘Free-flow’ charging, known as Dart Charge, was introduced at the Crossing in November 2014.  The collection and payment of the road user charge is carried out remotely so drivers no longer stop and pay within a barrier-controlled environment. Introducing ‘free-flow’ charging at Dartford has delivered improvement whilst the government develops further options for additional crossing capacity on the Lower Thames. \r\n\r\nDart Charge has reduced journey times for drivers. These have been delivered despite an increase in traffic volumes of 7.2% over the last year (almost an extra 3.7 million crossings). Drivers are also seeing other benefits. Over one million drivers have Dart Charge accounts and are saving up to a third on every crossing, and more people living in Dartford and Thurrock are benefitting from the Local Residents Discount scheme than ever before.\r\n\r\nEven with ‘free-flow’ charging the Government is aware that there is still a wider congestion problem. With around 55 million vehicle crossings a year the Crossing is currently operating at over 117% capacity and traffic is expected to continue to grow.  In the immediate term, HE is closely monitoring the performance of the Crossing and the motorway approaches, and is looking for measures to improve journey times and reduce incidents.\r\n\r\nTo reduce congestion at the Crossing, HE is looking at the tunnel operating systems, at how traffic uses the northbound approaches and at the response to incidents to see what can be done to improve them.  \r\n\r\nDrivers may experience some delays on the northbound approaches to the tunnels due to the operation of the tunnel safety system of traffic lights, which was introduced to prevent queuing traffic within the tunnels, and to control the passage of oversized vehicles and those carrying dangerous goods. Around 300 vehicles approach the tunnels in the wrong lane each month and the impact of just one oversized vehicle entering the wrong tunnel could be extremely severe.\r\n\r\nThe new system was put into operation in summer 2015. Since then work has been on-going to increase its efficiency in operation and a series of fine-tuning upgrades have been introduced to speed up the safe passage of vehicles. Further improvements are planned for the coming months. \r\n\r\nHE is also looking at the road signing on the northbound Crossing approaches to see what improvements can be made here. \r\n\r\nHE is also working with local authorities on both sides of the Crossing to improve traffic flows between the local and strategic road network, including a joint approach between HE and Kent County Council on a number of improvement measures for the junctions used by traffic approaching the Crossing from Dartford. Improvement plans include new lane markings, including yellow boxes, at Junctions 1A and 1B to reduce lane blocking on the roundabouts and smarter management of the traffic lights at junctions 1A, 1B and 2 (the Darenth Interchange) to improve traffic flows.\r\n\r\nThe impact that of these measures will be evaluated, and the public will be kept apprised of our findings.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport","created_at":"2016-10-03T15:30:45.049Z","updated_at":"2016-10-03T15:30:45.049Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":166711,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/166711.json"},"attributes":{"action":"April's Law","background":"We the undersigned call on the prime minister to make all sex offenders remain on the register for life no matter the crime, for service providers and search engines to be better policed regarding child abuse images and harder sentences on those caught with indecent images of children.","additional_details":"Five-year-old April Jones was murdered by paedophile Mark Bridger after being abducted from outside her home in Machynlleth October 2012.\r\nBefore April's abduction he was looking at child pornography.

","details":"Protecting the public from harm remains a priority for this Government, and we have been clear that those offenders who continue to pose a risk will remain subject to notification for life.  The public should rest assured that sex offenders will not automatically come off the register; the order only provides a mechanism by which a sex offender can apply for a review.   \r\n\r\nOn 30 July 2012 the Sexual Offences Act 2003 was amended by the Sexual Offences Act 2003 (Remedial) Order 2012 to introduce a mechanism which will enable registered sex offenders who are subject to notification requirements for life to apply for those requirements to be reviewed.  \r\n\r\nThis was as a result of an earlier Supreme Court ruling that our then law on indefinite sex offender registration without the right for review was incompatible with article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). \r\n\r\nThe Government fully acknowledged the ruling of the Supreme Court and took appropriate action as is its duty; to uphold the independence of the judiciary by complying with the judgement.\r\n\r\nUnder the previous Government, we made changes to the notification requirements introducing additional measures which sought to strengthen the existing mechanism by making it mandatory for all registered sex offenders to notify to the police:\r\n\r\n•\tall foreign travel;\r\n•\tweekly, where they are registered as having ‘no fixed abode’;\r\n•\twhere they are living in a household with a child under the age of 18; and;\r\n•\ttheir bank account and credit card details, and information about their passports or other identity documents.\r\n\r\nWe continue to work with the police and other law enforcement agencies to ensure that the right powers are available for the authorities to tackle sexual crimes and to bring perpetrators to justice. \r\n\r\n\r\nPolicing of child abuse images\r\n\r\nThe Government agrees that industry has a responsibility to work together with law enforcement and Government to prevent and inhibit the use of their services by those seeking to generate and share child abuse material. In 2015, Google announced that it had made changes to its search algorithm to prevent images and videos containing child abuse material from appearing in search results.  They have publicly stated there has been an eight-fold reduction in child sexual abuse image related search queries since. \r\n\r\nThe Internet Watch Foundation, which is funded by industry, has been active in facilitating the removal of indecent imagery of children from the internet. Their efforts have helped the UK see a reduction from the UK hosting 18% of web pages of child abuse imagery, to 0.2% by 2015.  Since April 2014 as permitted by Government, they have proactively sought out child sexual abuse material to take action to get this material removed.  \r\n\r\nAt the WePROTECT summit in December 2014, industry committed to taking digital hashes of known child abuse imagery in order to ensure these could be identified and referred to the US National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, and removed.  As of October 2016, over 34,750 image hashes have been shared among industry by the IWF. \r\n\r\nSentencing\r\n\r\nSentencing is entirely a matter for our independent courts.   When deciding what sentence to impose the courts take into account the circumstances of the offence and any mitigating and aggravating factors, in line with the sentencing guidelines.  Maximum penalties are kept under review to ensure that the courts have adequate powers to deal with offences effectively and proportionately.\r\n\r\nThe independent Sentencing Council are responsible for issuing guidelines to the courts.  In December 2013 the Sentencing Council issued a revised guideline on sentencing for sexual offences, which came into force in England and Wales in April 2014.  \r\n\r\nUnder the Protection of Children Act 1978 (as amended), the UK prohibits the taking, making circulation and possession with a view to distribution of any indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph of a child under 16.  Such offences carry a maximum sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment.  Section 160 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 also makes the simple possession of indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs of children an offence.  This carries a maximum sentence of 5 years’ imprisonment.  This age was raised to 18 in the Sexual Offences Act 2003 and there are defences for those aged over the age of consent (16) who produce sexual photographs for their own use within a marriage or civil partnership.  These defences are lost, however, if such images are distributed. \r\n\r\nThe Sexual Offences 2003 Act significantly modernised and strengthened the laws on sexual offences in England and Wales to provide extra protection to children from sexual abuse and sexual exploitation.  It was designed to meet 21st century challenges of protecting children, and addresses issues including internet pornography and ‘grooming’ children for sexual abuse.  \r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2016-11-09T13:23:12.643Z","updated_at":"2016-11-09T13:23:12.643Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":169433,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/169433.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Ban the use of previous sexual history as evidence in sexual abuse or rape cases","background":"Section 41 of the rape and sexual offences act 1999 states that the sexual history of the claimant can be used as evidence in cases in the U.K. We the undersigned agree that this should be stopped and previous sexual history should be inadmissible in court.","additional_details":"http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/p_to_r/rape_and_sexual_offences/yjcea_1999/","state":"open","signature_count":16163,"created_at":"2016-10-14T16:34:53.475Z","updated_at":"2016-11-19T15:35:01.714Z","open_at":"2016-10-18T10:12:22.042Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":"2016-11-02T16:22:51.628Z","scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2016-10-14T16:53:34.308Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2016-10-19T21:28:50.632Z","creator_name":"Louisa Carol pawsey ","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"The law restricts the circumstances in which evidence of complainants’ sexual history may be used in trials of sexual offences.

Woodcock, snipe and golden plover are amongst those species that may be taken. In England and Wales the dates for woodcock are 1 October to 31 January; common snipe 12 August to 31 January; golden plover 1 September to 31 January.\r\n \r\nShooting is a legitimate activity and in addition to providing jobs and investment in some of our most remote areas, it can offer important benefits for wildlife and habitat conservation. The Government’s manifesto commits to protect shooting for the benefits it brings to individuals, the environment and the rural economy.\r\n\r\nRecent data shows that the woodcock has a breeding population or around 78,000 pairs; common snipe 76,000 and golden plover between 38,000 and 59,000. Overwintering populations increase their numbers to approximately 1.4 million (woodcock), 1 million (common snipe) and 400,000 (golden plover). The numbers in winter are greatly increased as a result of birds arriving from Scandinavia, the Baltic States and Russia and many of our breeding birds (and their offspring) leave the country in winter.  \r\n\r\nFor all three species, the numbers of birds hunted is small compared with the population present in the country during the open season.\r\n\r\nWhen combined with the fact that many of our breeding birds winter abroad, it is unlikely that hunting pressure in this country has played a significant role in the recent downwards trends in the size and range of GB breeding populations of either woodcock or snipe. There is little evidence that the golden plover is currently in decline in GB as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for any declines are complex and include habitat loss as a result of land drainage, the drying out of natural woodlands, declining woodland management, the maturation of new plantations, overgrazing by deer, recreational disturbance and reductions in prey availability. The woodcock is currently red-listed due to breeding range decline in the past 25 years.\r\n\r\nMeasures have been taken to improve habitats through Environmental Land Management schemes such as the Countryside Stewardship Scheme, where grassland breeding waders have been specifically targeted. The woodcock will have benefited from Woodland Grant Schemes, some of which specifically target management for declining woodland birds.\r\n\r\nThe Government is not persuaded that the current level of hunting has a significant detrimental impact on the numbers of woodcock, common snipe and golden plover. A number of English estates have already instigated their own voluntary bans on the shooting of woodcock.

That is why we are committed to introducing fairer funding for schools so that funding is transparently matched to schools’ and children’s needs. In doing so, we will fund the education system in a way that promotes social mobility and social justice.\r\n\r\nEarlier this year we conducted the first stage of consultation on our proposals for making the funding system fairer by introducing the National Funding Formulae (NFF) for schools and high needs. We initially proposed to introduce the NFF from 2017-18.\r\n \r\nIn July the Secretary of State announced that the NFF will be introduced in 2018-19 instead, to allow time for full and proper consultation on these important proposals. It also allowed us to give certainty to local authorities about their budgets in 2017-18.\r\n\r\nWe recognise West Sussex is a relatively low-funded local authority. In 2015-16 we took a step towards fairer funding by allocating an additional £390 million to low funded authorities through the “minimum funding levels” reform.

The extra funding for West Sussex was included in their baseline in 2016-17, and is protected in their baseline for 2017-18.\r\n \r\nWe also recognise that many schools are facing cost pressures and that they have worked to find efficiencies.

As well as improving the employability of their graduates, mobility periods enhance the overall student experience the institution is able to offer prospective students, making them more competitive in terms of the students they can attract.  Furthermore, increasing student exchanges with institutions abroad can contribute to the institution’s overall internationalisation strategy – leading to greater research collaboration between academics, for example, and improving the global reputation of the institution.  Because we value these benefits the Government is supporting a sector led UK strategy for Outward Mobility, which aims to increase the number of UK students who access international placements as part of their degree programmes. (http://www.go.international.ac.uk/go-abroad.) To support such mobility students on the EU Erasmus scheme for a full year abroad have their tuition fees capped at 15% of the permitted level for their institution in the year they spend abroad, and are entitled to an additional tuition fee loan to cover this. Their institutions receive a HEFCE grant of £2,250 per student for that year in addition to the 15% fee from the student. These 'fee waiver' arrangements also apply to those going abroad to study, but not work, under other mobility schemes.  \r\n\r\nErasmus (European Action Scheme for the Mobility of University Students) began in 1986 and its popularity is such that it has given its name to the entire EU education, training youth and sport programme, 'Erasmus+', which runs from 2014-20, and which provides funding for the specific Erasmus HE mobility scheme. It enables university students at all levels to undertake study or work placements in another EU country, or certain others (the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Turkey) as part of their course.  The minimum placement period under the scheme is three months, or two for work placements, and the maximum one year. It is currently the largest single such student mobility scheme for UK students; in 2013/14 there were 15,566 Erasmus placements in Europe. The vast majority of outgoing Erasmus students are undergraduates, and a little less than half are studying languages. In 2012/13 27,147 European students undertook a placement in the UK. It is up to individual institutions to decide how many students they send and receive.\r\n\r\nThe scheme is administered in the UK by the Erasmus+ National Agency, which receives funding from the EU Erasmus+ programme to fund outgoing students (the Government pays the Agency a management fee to cover the administrative costs). Students receive a non-means tested grant of between €250 and €400 per month whilst abroad, depending on which country they visit. Premiums of €100 per month are paid to all on work placements and to those on study placements qualifying as disadvantaged students.  Additional help from EU funding is available for those with special needs.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education","created_at":"2016-09-19T10:43:42.751Z","updated_at":"2016-09-19T10:43:42.751Z"},"debate":null}}]}
