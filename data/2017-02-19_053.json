For the true meaning of life is not to learn of the men of old, but to do what one wishes and see this world truly, not through the eyes of \"greater\" men. Therefore, do not waste the very pinnacle of life with whiteboards and desks and pens, but allow our children to discover the world for themselves and come to love it, and not make them stress, toil and anger over copious works of other people. By this they will be more creative, making their own view, and will lead to a more advanced, happier and better society.","state":"open","signature_count":6,"created_at":"2017-02-09T21:33:06.102Z","updated_at":"2017-02-15T18:26:13.819Z","open_at":"2017-02-15T18:26:13.818Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-02-09T22:11:44.982Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"creator_name":"Ben Fuller","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":184171,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/184171.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Offer a National Savings \u0026 Investments Product that pays a 6% interest rate.","background":"21 Million Savers have again sustained a new blow, following National Savings interest rates recently being cut by up to 0.25 per cent.The Prime Minister, The Rt.
