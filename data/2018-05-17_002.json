They are an important indicator of the great strides we have made in improving our waterways, with more than 5,300 miles of rivers being improved since 2010. There have been no reintroductions of otters by conservation groups since the late 1990s and the bulk of the recovery of the otter has been through natural re-colonisation.  \r\n\r\nA healthy otter population results from favourable conditions in the natural environment, including water quality and the availability of prey (including fish), as well as availability of breeding sites. Otters are found at low density, and limit their own populations through territorial activity. Carrying capacity is determined by environmental conditions.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence to suggest that otters have a major impact on wildlife as a whole, and although localised impacts could occur where otters have not been previously present for some time, they are a natural part of the freshwater ecosystem and we believe these systems will adapt to the return of the natural top predator.  \r\n\r\nWe do recognise that otters can in some instances impact on still water fisheries, which is why there is provision through the Angling Improvement Fund (AIF), administered by the Angling Trust on the Environment Agency’s behalf, to help deliver improvements including projects to protect fisheries from otter predation through the erection of otter-proof fencing. Further information can be found on the Angling Trust website at: www.anglingtrust.net.\r\n\r\nOtters are a protected species and it is an offence to harm capture, kill, disturb or injure any animal and/or damage, destroy or obstruct their resting or sheltering places. Therefore any methods of control, including non-lethal methods, would constitute an offence.

As the Prime Minister said when she attended the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) in 2016 “intelligence we have received in the past from Saudi Arabia has saved potentially hundreds of lives in the UK.”\r\n\r\nEngagement with Saudi Arabia provides an opportunity to further develop our relationship, building the trust and respect necessary to enhance our engagement on all areas of mutual concern. Visits in both directions are an important opportunity for us to have constructive discussions about the full range of issues that are of mutual concern. \r\n\r\nThe Crown Prince has embarked on a series of reforms to modernise society and the economy within Saudi Arabia. The country is changing rapidly, with steps such as allowing women to drive and attend football matches, reopening cinemas and a commitment that women will make up one third of the Saudi workforce by 2030. The Crown Prince has also set out his commitment to return Saudi Arabia to a moderate Islam that is open to all religions.\r\n\r\nThis greater inclusivity is vital for the future of Saudi Arabia and the UK will support Saudi Arabia as it embarks on this era of change. The Crown Prince’s agenda will bring new opportunities for us to work together for the long-term benefit, stability and success of both our countries. \r\nWe welcome the recent positive developments, but we also recognise that there are further steps to take. \r\nOur starting point for engagement on human rights with all countries is based on what is practical, realistic and achievable, and we will always be ready to speak out as a matter of principle. We raise our concerns with the Saudi Arabian authorities using a range of Ministerial and diplomatic channels of communication, including our Ambassador, the Embassy team and the European Union in Riyadh. So whilst there are areas where we will continue to have different views to Saudi Arabia – including human rights - our relationship enables us to speak frankly, openly and constructively about these issues.\r\n\r\nOn Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, along with other GCC member states, provided support to the Government of Bahrain in 2011 as part of the Peninsula Shield agreement. At the request of the Government of Bahrain, GCC security personnel were deployed to Bahrain to ensure vital infrastructure was secure. The UK monitors events in Bahrain closely and where we have concerns we raise these at senior levels. \r\n\r\nThe UK is committed to securing a political solution that ends the humanitarian disaster in Yemen, and supports the UN Special Envoy to Yemen in facilitating a credible peace process. The UK will continue to play a leading role in supporting the UN to find a peaceful solution to the conflict, including through close engagement with our regional and international partners. Inward visits provide further opportunities for the UK to discuss solutions to the crisis. \r\n\r\nThe UK supports the Saudi-led Coalition military intervention, which came at the request of the internationally-recognised Yemeni President Hadi, to deter aggression by the Houthis, and allow for the return of the legitimate Yemeni Government.  The Houthis have consistently failed to adhere to UN Security Council Resolutions, including by launching attacks against Saudi Arabia and shipping in the Bab al-Mandab strait.\r\n\r\nWe regularly raise the importance of compliance with International Humanitarian Law (IHL) with the Saudi Arabian Government and other members of the military Coalition. Saudi Arabia has publicly stated that it is investigating reports of alleged violations of IHL, and that lessons will be acted upon.  We continue to monitor the situation closely.\r\n\r\nThe UK government takes its defence export responsibilities very seriously and operates one of the most robust export control regimes in the world.

If however, all suitable treatments fail, or cease to provide benefit to the patient, they may, ethically and legally, be withheld or withdrawn, and the focus of treatment changed to the relief of symptoms. In practice, the decision to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment is of course, often very difficult.  \r\n\r\nDoctors, nurses and other clinicians who are delivering care to severely ill patients are required at all times to have regard to the best interests of the patient when considering what treatment is appropriate and indeed, whether to continue life sustaining treatment. \r\n\r\nWhere there is disagreement between those with parental responsibility and treating clinicians about a child’s treatment, including whether to continue life sustaining treatment, the court will be asked to determine what is in the child’s best interest. The views of the parents will be very important in the court reaching decisions, but it is the child’s best interests that are paramount, not the rights of those with parental responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe power to consent must be exercised according to the ‘welfare principle’: that the child’s ‘welfare’ or ‘best interests’ must be paramount. Even where a child lacks capacity to consent on their own behalf, it is good practice to involve the child as much as possible in the decision-making process. \r\n\r\nIf children have the capacity to give consent for themselves, consent should be sought directly from them. Once young people reach the age of 16, they are presumed in law to be competent to give consent for themselves for their own surgical, medical or dental treatment, and any associated procedures, such as investigations, anaesthesia or nursing care. Those under 16 are not automatically presumed to be legally competent to make decisions about their healthcare. Under-16s will be competent to give valid consent to a particular intervention if they have sufficient understanding and intelligence to enable him or her to understand fully what is proposed.  If a child is not competent to give consent for themselves, consent should be sought from a person with parental responsibility. \r\n\r\nAs is the case where patients are giving consent for themselves, those giving consent on behalf of child patients, must have the capacity to consent to the intervention in question, be acting voluntarily and be appropriately informed. The power to consent must be exercised according to the ‘welfare principle’: that the child’s ‘welfare’ or ‘best interests’ must be paramount. \r\n\r\nDuty of Clinicians, Secretary of State and Government powers\r\n\r\nThe duty of clinicians and the courts to treat the child’s best interests as paramount is consistent with the European Court of Human Rights and international conventions on the rights of the child.

","details":"The UK welcomes genuine visitors to the UK. The visitor routes are for people who are coming to the UK for a temporary purpose, usually for up to six months. Visitors should not be living in the UK through frequent or successive visits or making the UK their main home. \r\n\r\nEvery visitor is assessed against the same Immigration Rules regardless of nationality. The only difference is where that assessment is made. Some individuals are assessed overseas by an entry clearance officer, while others are assessed at the UK border. All visitors to the UK are assessed against the Immigration Rules on a case by case basis.\r\n\r\nNationals of some non-EEA countries need a visa to visit the UK. Visas are an important part of securing the UK’s border and are an effective tool for the UK in reducing illegal immigration, tackling organised crime and protecting national security. \r\n\r\nAdopting a similar model to that of Canada and allowing a select group of people to remain in the UK for 2 years as visitors, would mean that important considerations against the Immigration Rules would not be applied consistently and could raise equality concerns. \r\n\r\nThe Government recognises the importance of family ties. Visit visas are available with validities of 6 months, 2 years, 5 years and 10 years, allowing individuals wishing to visit the UK regularly or at short notice to do so without having to apply for a new visa each time they wish to travel. \r\n\r\nThe family Immigration Rules were reformed in July 2012 to prevent burdens on the taxpayer, promote integration and tackle abuse, and thereby ensure that family migration to the UK is on a properly sustainable basis that it is fair to migrants and the wider community. \r\n \r\nWe reformed the route for adult dependent relatives, given the significant NHS and social care costs which can be associated with these cases.  The Department of Health has estimated that a person living to the age of 85 costs the NHS on average around £150,000 in their lifetime, with more than 50% of this cost arising from the age of 65 onwards.  This figure does not take account of any social care costs met by local authorities. \r\n\r\nUnder the rules, adult dependants must demonstrate that, as a result of age, illness or disability, they require a level of long-term personal care that can only be provided in the UK by their sponsor here and without recourse to public funds.  They must apply from overseas, not while in the UK as a visitor. \r\n\r\nAs well as the significant NHS and social care costs to which these cases can give rise, there are also broader issues of fairness.  Adult dependent relatives can continue to visit a family member in the UK (for up to six months) but must return home at the end of their visit: we do not allow visitors to switch into other immigration categories while in the UK and the adult dependent relative category should not be an exception.  There should also not be a routine expectation of settlement in the UK for parents and grandparents aged 65 or over.  Only those requiring long-term personal care that cannot be delivered in the country in which they are living should be eligible to settle in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe rules for adult dependent relatives seek to ensure that only those who need to be physically close to and cared for by a close relative in the UK are able to settle here.  Those who do not have such care needs can be supported financially in the country in which they live by their relative in the UK.  Those most in need of care remain most likely to qualify, compared with those who simply have a preference to come and live in the UK with a relative here.  The lawfulness of the rules was upheld by the Court of Appeal in May 2017. \r\n\r\nThe rules do not provide a route for every parent to join their adult child in the UK and settle here and it is not intended that they should do so.  Overall, the rules represent a fairer deal for the taxpayer, given the significant NHS and social care costs which can arise when adult dependent relatives settle in the UK.\r\n\r\nHome Office\r\n","created_at":"2018-05-03T11:36:09.186Z","updated_at":"2018-05-03T11:36:09.186Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":214118,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/214118.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Consult with women on proposals to enshrine 'gender identity' in law","background":"The government proposes to amend the law to allow people to self-identify as men or women, and to stop allowing organisations in sensitive situations to exclude people of the opposite birth sex.

","details":"The Government recognises the valuable service that good letting agents provide to both landlords and tenants in ensuring that properties are safe, compliant and professionally managed. We are keen to see all tenants receiving a good and affordable service. A ban on letting fees paid by tenants will improve transparency and affordability for renters - letting fees are currently not clearly or consistently explained with the result that many tenants are unaware of the true costs of renting a property.\r\n\r\nThe Government published the draft Tenant Fees Bill on 1 November (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/draft-tenants-fees-bill), which sets out the detailed approach to banning letting fees to tenants in England, helping millions of renters by bringing an end to costly upfront payments and renewal fees.\r\n\r\nThe draft Tenant Fees Bill reflects feedback from the eight week public consultation (April – June 2017), which received over 4,700 responses. More than 9 out of 10 tenants who responded to the consultation backed the action to ban letting fees. We are ensuring that tenants will only be required to pay rent alongside a refundable deposit.\r\n\r\nMany letting agents and landlords acknowledge that fees charged to tenants are currently not at a level that is justifiable and agree that intervention is necessary. The Government does not believe that a cap would be effective and is likely to lead to a race to the top in terms of fees charged. A ban is easier to understand and enforce.\r\n\r\nWe believe that tenants will see a net saving as a result of the ban.  Tenants will be able to see what a given property will cost them in the advertised rent level without any additional hidden costs. This will help to make entering and moving around in the private rented sector easier and less costly.\r\n\r\nWe recognise that agents will need to consider their business models. The time of, and services provided by, letting agents should be reimbursed but this should be by landlords rather than tenants. Landlords are better able to shop around for the agent offering the service that they are seeking at the price they want to pay. It is also worth noting that landlords, unlike tenants, can claim tax relief on letting agent fees.\r\n\r\nGood letting agents, providing services that represent value for money to landlords, will continue to play an important role in the market. Furthermore, such letting agents will be on a fairer footing to compete for landlords’ business since it will be much harder for rogue agents to exploit their position between landlords and tenants. \r\n \r\nPublishing a bill in draft enables scrutiny of our proposals to ban letting fees by Parliament and stakeholders ahead of introducing legislation. The Communities and Local Government Select Committee is currently holding a public inquiry into the draft Bill. We welcome Parliamentary scrutiny on whether the draft Bill achieves its aim of delivering a fairer, more competitive, and more affordable lettings market where tenants have greater clarity and control over what they will pay and where the landlord is the primary customer of the letting agent. The Government will then seek to introduce the Bill formally to Parliament at the earliest opportunity. We will do this as soon as parliamentary time allows. We do not expect implementation to be before April 2019. This will allow letting agents time to prepare and re-negotiate their contracts.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Housing, Communities and Local Government","created_at":"2018-02-20T12:01:09.205Z","updated_at":"2018-02-20T13:48:40.475Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":208723,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/208723.json"},"attributes":{"action":"UK Government to raise the murder of Carl Davies with the Government of France","background":"In 2011 a former Royal Marine working in Maritime Security called Carl Davies was murdered on the French Island of Reunion in the Indian Ocean.
