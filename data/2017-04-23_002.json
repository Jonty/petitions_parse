We are not proposing to cut specific services.","details":"The Department for Transport has launched a public consultation to seek passengers’ views on their priorities for the train service on the South Eastern network.  These will be used by the Department of Transport to specify the service required from the next train operator, which is planned to start in December 2018.  \r\n\r\nThe public consultation seeks views on all aspects of the train service, including the provision of more space for passengers, improvements to customer service, simplifying fares and ticketing, improving access and facilities at stations, priorities for speeding up journeys, and providing additional services.\r\n\r\nQuestion 17 seeks views about whether passengers would support the principle of reducing the choice of London termini served from individual stations to provide a more regular timetable and reliable service.  We are not proposing to reduce or change specific services.  An example is provided to explain how the concept could potentially operate in practice if passengers supported it.    \r\n\r\nThis question is being asked because passengers have indicated that reducing delays is a priority.  Paragraph 4.6 of the consultation document explains that one of the causes of delays is the need for trains to cross complex junctions at key points such as London Bridge and Lewisham, which are operating at close to maximum capability.  Reducing the need for trains to cross these junctions, by reducing the number of London termini served from individual stations, would help to reduce delays.  \r\n\r\nJourneys could also be quicker.  It is currently necessary to add in waiting times at stations to timetable moves across these junctions and these could be reduced or eliminated if services ran to a single London termini.\r\n\r\nIn the peak periods, the majority of passengers change at London Bridge, although a significant number do continue through to Cannon Street, Waterloo East, and Charing Cross.  We know that these passengers value a choice of London stations.  \r\n\r\nWe are therefore seeking passengers’ views on the principle of reducing the choice of London termini to provide a more regular timetable and reliable service.   \r\n\r\nIn answering this question, it is important to consider the many new journey choices for passengers that will result from the completion of the Thameslink programme and the opening of the Elizabeth line.  For example, by 2019, passengers from many South Eastern stations will be able to travel via Abbey Wood or Woolwich for fast and regular onward connections to Canary Wharf and central London.  Many more passengers will change at London Bridge to join Thameslink trains that run every five minutes between London Bridge-Blackfriars-City Thameslink-Farringdon-St. Pancras. \r\n\r\nOn the Bexleyheath line the number of passengers from intermediate stations between Dartford and Lewisham and who travel beyond Lewisham towards Victoria is relatively small when compared with those travelling on much faster trains to London Bridge. In the future some passenger from the outer stations on this route will travel via Abbey Wood and the Elizabeth line, or change at London Bridge for Thameslink onward connections. Overall all passengers will benefit from more reliable journeys and many will benefit from faster journey times. \r\n\r\nThe public consultation will end on 23 May 2017, after which the Department for Transport will carefully analyse each response.  The conclusions will be published in the Autumn in a Stakeholder Response document. \r\n\r\nIt is important to note that there would need to be a separate public consultation by the next train operator before any significant timetable changes were introduced, and this would include reducing the choice of London termini served from stations on the South Eastern network.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport","created_at":"2017-04-10T14:56:59.452Z","updated_at":"2017-04-10T14:56:59.452Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":177333,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/177333.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Give communities back the right to decide where houses are built.","background":"This petition calls for a parliamentary debate on government Housing and Planning policy over building on greenfield land and seeks community right of appeal on planning decisions and the removal of the presumption in favour of sustainable development.

Communities are consulted throughout the Local Plan process and on individual planning applications.","details":"The National Planning Policy Framework strongly encourages all local planning authorities to get up-to-date Local Plans in place as soon as possible, in consultation with the local community. Up-to-date Local Plans ensure that communities get the right development, in the right place, at the right time, reflecting the principles of sustainable development. Through the White Paper we are ensuring that every part of the country produces, maintains and implements an up-to-date plan, yet with the flexibility for local areas to decide how to plan in a way that best meets their needs. \r\n\r\nA wide section of the community should be proactively engaged so that Local Plans, as far as possible, reflect a collective vision and a set of agreed priorities for the sustainable development of the area, including those contained in any neighbourhood plans that have been made.\r\n\r\nThe Framework recognises the intrinsic character and beauty of the countryside.  That is why our proposals are focussed on development in built up areas.  \r\nWe are also absolutely clear that Green Belt must be protected and that there are other areas that local authorities must pursue first, such as brownfield land and taking steps to increase density on urban sites. The Government is committed to maximising the use of brownfield land and has already embarked on an ambitious programme to bring brownfield land back into use.  \r\n\r\nWe believe that developers should mitigate the impacts of development. This is vital to make it acceptable to the local community and to addresses the cumulative impact of development in an area. Both the Community Infrastructure Levy and Section 106 agreements can be used by local planning authorities to help fund supporting infrastructure and address the cumulative demand that development places on infrastructure. Through the White Paper, the Government announced that it will examine the options for reforming the existing system of developer contributions to see how this can be simplified, with further announcements at Autumn Budget 2017.\r\n\r\nThe £2.3billion Housing Infrastructure Fund will deliver up to 100,000 new homes by putting in the right infrastructure, in the right place, at the right time. We expect the fund to be able to deliver a variety of types of infrastructure necessary to unlock housing growth in high demand areas.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing automatic about grants of planning permission where there is not yet an up-to-date Local Plan. It is still up to local decision-makers to interpret and apply national policy to local circumstances, alongside the views of the local community. Applications should not be approved if the adverse impacts would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits; or if specific policies in the Framework indicate that development should be restricted.\r\n\r\nCommunities are also able to make representations on individual planning applications and in response to most appeals by the applicant against a local authority decision. Interested parties can raise all the issues that concern them during the planning process, in the knowledge that the decision maker will take their views into account, along with other material considerations, in reaching a decision. \r\n\r\nWe therefore do not believe a right of appeal against the grant of planning permission for communities is necessary. It is considered that communities already have plenty of opportunity to have their say on local planning issues, and it would be wrong for them to be able to delay a development at the last minute, through a community right of appeal, when any issues they would raise at that point could have been raised and should have been considered during the earlier planning application process. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Communities and Local Government","created_at":"2017-02-27T15:21:06.837Z","updated_at":"2017-02-27T15:21:06.837Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":170207,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/170207.json"},"attributes":{"action":"For Parliament to ban the non-stun slaughter of animals in the UK.","background":"The United Kingdom has a proud and admirable record in animal welfare.

We are investing in the biggest modernisation programme for a generation, bringing our transport system into the 21st Century. We want to deliver changes that really make a difference for the travelling public, as quickly and efficiently as possible.\r\n\r\nTackling air pollution matters. Although the UK currently meets the legal limits for almost all pollutants, further work is still needed – particularly to reduce levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in some towns and cities. Poor air damages public health in the UK, with the most severe effects experienced by the vulnerable: children and the elderly, and people with lung and heart conditions. Where we are above legal limits in our towns and cities transport is responsible for around 80% of NOx emissions at the roadside. \r\n\r\nSince 2011 the Government has committed more than £2 billion to increase the uptake of ultra low emission vehicles (ULEVs) and support greener transport schemes. In addition, the Chancellor has committed a further £290 million to support electric vehicles, low emission buses and taxis, and alternative fuels.\r\n\r\nDiesel vehicles have played, and continue to play a role in reducing fuel usage and emissions of carbon dioxide.  Diesel vehicles have failed to deliver expected emission reductions in real world driving conditions. That is why the UK led the way to secure agreement at EU level to introduce more stringent real driving emissions testing for all new cars and vans across the EU from September 2017, ensuring that vehicle manufacturers live up to their low emission credentials.\r\n\r\nThe national air quality plan for NO2 published in December 2015, set out a programme for Clean Air Zones, alongside national action and continued investment in clean technologies. Clean Air Zones can be a targeted and proportionate approach to reducing emissions by encouraging the replacement of old, polluting vehicles (including buses, taxis and heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) with modern, cleaner technologies.  The Clean Air Zone framework will be updated in spring this year.\r\n\r\nThe setting of charges for on or off-street parking is a matter for local authorities.  The Government recommends that authorities set charges at levels which are consistent with the aims of the authority’s transport strategy, including its air quality, road safety and traffic management strategies. Authorities should never use parking charges just to raise revenue. \r\n\r\nThe Government is considering next steps on the need to tackle levels of NO2 in light of both updated information on real world emissions from diesel vehicles and the High Court judgment last year.

No further changes can be justified given the underlying imperative must be to focus public resources on those most in need.","details":"The gradual equalisation of State Pension age (SPa) at 65 was first set out in the Pensions Act 1995.This was necessary to meet the UK’s obligations under EU law to eliminate gender inequalities in social security provision.\r\n\r\nThe increase in SPa to 66 was set out in the 2007 Pensions Act (PA) and due to increasing life expectancy the 2011 PA accelerated this process to allow for a rise to 66 for all by 2020 and equalised the SPa at 65 by November 2018.\r\n\r\nDuring the 2011 PA the Government made a concession worth £1.1bn which slowed down the increases to SPa so no one would face an increase of more than 18 months compared to the 1995 PA. For 81% of these women the increase will be no more than 12 months. This concession benefited almost 250,000 women who would otherwise have experienced delays of up to two years.\r\n\r\nIt is unclear whether reversing the 1995 PA would be legal under current equality legislation. The requirement to take account of equality between men and women in framing new legislation means that any new transitional provisions aimed just at women runs the risk of legal challenge. It would certainly be unaffordable. As of 2010, without equalisation, women would have spent on average 41% of their adult lives in retirement, compared to men at 31%.Even after equalising women’s SPa with men’s, women will spend on average around 2 years more in receipt of their state pension because of their longer life expectancy. Women reaching 65 in 2018 are expected to live until 88.9 whilst the figure for men is 86.7 years. \r\n\r\nThe early retirement option at a reduced rate, even if it were actuarially neutral, would result in additional cost to the state from the loss of taxes. There are wider impact costs on the economy; adding one year to working lives would result in sustained increases to GDP of over 1%.If GDP in 2015 had been 1% higher, £18 billion would have been added to the economy. \r\n\r\nBy 2035 50% (29.6 million) of the adult population will be aged 50 and over. To support these individuals in work the Default Retirement Age was abolished and the right to request flexible working extended.\r\n\r\nResearch by IFS shows that employment rates have increased for women aged 60 and 61 as a result of rising Spa. Working longer can improve and maintain physical and mental health – evidence shows that making adjustments and changing working patterns can help older workers to manage health issues and stay in work. Beyond financial matters, 38% of retirees said they missed work for the “social interaction”, according to a DWP poll.\r\n\r\nThe ‘reduced pension at an earlier stage’ proposal cuts across the government’s policy on Fuller Working Lives (FWL). It would be impractical within the time period to help those most affected by 2011 SPa changes.\r\n\r\nAn actuarially reduced pension would complicate State Pension outcomes and, if people’s reduced state pension were below test the standard minimum guarantee in Pension Credit, it might increase the need for means-tested support amongst pensioners.\r\n \r\nFor those who have not reached SPa, and who are not working, the current working age benefits regime provides the safety net for those seeking employment, and those unable to work either due to disability or caring responsibilities. The latter may qualify for financial support from Employment and Support Allowance. The Government is committed to providing this support, spending around £50 billion a year on disability benefits. Carers Allowance and related benefits provide financial support and safeguards for carers and families, including those who are ill or disabled.\r\n\r\nPeople in receipt of working age benefits can access a range of support from Jobcentre Plus and the Work Programme. Supporting individuals aged 50 and over to remain in the labour market and tackling their barriers is a Government priority. DWP introduced ‘Older Claimant Champions’ in April 2015 across Jobcentre Plus to tackle barriers faced by older claimants in finding work. They work with Work Coaches and employers to raise the profile and highlight the benefits of employing older people.\r\n\r\nThe Fuller Working Lives strategy (2.2.17) aims to increase the retention, retraining and recruitment of older workers by bringing about a change in employer’s perceptions, and challenging views of retirement amongst individuals.\r\nThe new State Pension is more generous for many women who have been historically worse off under the old system. On average, women reaching SPa last year will get a higher state pension over their lifetimes than women who reached SPa at any point before them. By 2030, over 3 million women stand to gain an average of £550 extra per year as a result of these changes.\r\n\r\nThe Government has already made a concession for those most affected by SPa changes and introducing further transitional arrangements cannot be justified. The Government has been very clear. There will be no further changes to current arrangements or any financial redress in lieu of pensions.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions","created_at":"2017-03-01T16:49:31.856Z","updated_at":"2017-03-01T17:49:19.821Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":183921,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/183921.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Do not abandon the Dubs Scheme for refugee children","background":"On 8th February, the government ended its committment to taking in unaccommpanied child refugees, stating that we do not have the capacity for the 3,000 refugee children we promised to take.

So far, over 5,400 individuals have been resettled under the Syrian Vulnerable Person’s Scheme since its expansion in September 2015.\r\n\r\nCrucially, our resettlement schemes help ensure that children do not become unaccompanied.  They allow children to be resettled with their family members, before they become unaccompanied, and before attempting perilous journeys to Europe.  \r\n\r\nWe have announced that we will transfer 350 children to the UK under Section 67 of the Immigration Act 2016 (the so called “Dubs Amendment”).  It has never been the case, as has been suggested, that the Government would accept 3,000 children from Europe under Section 67 of the Immigration Act or that this would be an ongoing obligation; Parliament voted against such an amendment. The legislation is clear that the Government has the obligation to specify the number of children to be relocated, after consultation with local authorities, and to relocate that number of children to the UK.\r\n\r\nThe consultation to establish local authorities' capacity to accommodate unaccompanied minors began in May 2016 as soon as the Immigration Act was passed. Throughout the summer, the Home Office organised a number of regional events to engage local authorities on the issue. In September and October 2016, the Immigration Minister and Home Secretary respectively, wrote to local authorities seeking additional places for the National Transfer Scheme and to inform them of the situation regarding the Calais camp clearance.\r\n\r\nThe care and support that the UK provides for unaccompanied asylum-seeking children does not end when the children arrive in the UK; resources and professional support are put in place to ensure these children receive the care and compassion they need.  We are grateful for the way in which local authorities have stepped up to provide places and look after these young people.\r\n\r\nWe have launched the National Transfer Scheme to ensure a fairer distribution of the estimated 4,500 UASC in local authority care.  To support this, we have significantly increased funding for local authorities by 20 per cent and 28 per cent for under 16s and 16 and 17 year olds respectively. \r\n\r\nWe transferred over 900 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children to the UK in 2016 including more than 750 from France as part of the UK’s comprehensive support for the Calais camp clearance. Over 200 children have already arrived in the UK through Section 67 of the Immigration Act 2016; this is almost as many unaccompanied children from within Europe to the UK as the entire EU relocation scheme. We continue to work with our European partners to meet our obligations under the Dublin Regulation.\r\n\r\nThe UK has been at the forefront of the response to the events in Syria and the region, pledging over £2.3 billion in aid; our largest ever humanitarian response to a single crisis. We have also committed over £100 million of humanitarian support to help alleviate the Mediterranean migration crisis in Europe and North Africa. \r\n\r\nThe UK helped to launch and mobilise international support for UNICEF’s No Lost Generation Initiative (NLGI), providing £431 million of funding. This provides protection, basic mental health support and education for children affected by the Syria crisis.\r\n\r\nOur aid spending is making a huge difference to the lives of children in the conflict region; for the same investment that it would take to support 3,000 unaccompanied asylum-seeking children under the age of 16 in the UK, we were able to help over 800,000 children in Syria and the surrounding region access healthcare, support, and education in 2016. Within Europe, the UK has also established a £10 million Refugee Children’s Fund to support the needs of vulnerable refugee and migrant children arriving in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe Government has taken significant steps to improve an already comprehensive approach to supporting asylum seeking and refugee children, our work on unaccompanied children in Europe further underlines the Government’s commitment to playing its part in the global migration crisis.  \r\n\r\nThis important issue was recently debated during a Backbench Business Committee debate on Thursday 23 February 2017. \r\n\r\nHome Office\r\n","created_at":"2017-03-10T13:25:08.337Z","updated_at":"2017-03-10T13:25:08.337Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":175654,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/175654.json"},"attributes":{"action":"MPs' salary rises to be restricted to the same as public sector workers by law","background":"Public Sector workers have been restricted to a 1% annual pay rise for the last five years, a lot of them have had a pay freeze during this time, whilst MPs are exempt  from the restrictions they place on Public Sector workers.

Implementing these reforms will enable insurers to cut motor insurance premiums by around £40 per policy.","details":"The reforms on which the government consulted build on previous reforms to control and reduce the costs of civil litigation. The consultation ran from 17 November 2016 to 6 January 2017 and the government will publish its response to the consultation shortly.  \r\n\r\nThe current small claims track limit for all claims other than personal injury and housing disrepair claims is £10,000. Claims above these limits are generally dealt with in the fast track if valued up to £25,000 or the multi-track if above £25,000.  In the small claims track the costs are generally borne by each side, whereas legal costs are generally recoverable by the winning party in the fast and multi-tracks. The government consulted on raising the small claims limit to £5,000 for personal injury claims, as the limit has been set at £1,000 since 1991 and an increase is long overdue.\r\nAs set out in the consultation, raising the small claims limit in personal injury cases to £5,000 would cover relatively straightforward, minor personal injury claims, which should not need legal representation. However claimants are not, and would not, be precluded from seeking legal representation in the small claims track if they so wished. Support for litigants in person is also available from a number of advice organisations and online sources. It should also be remembered that whilst the financial limits are one of the primary factors considered as to which track a claim should be in, the court can, on application, transfer a claim to the fast or multi track if it is particularly complex. \r\n\r\nIn addition to proposing to raise the small claims limit, the government consulted (1)  on removing the right to claim compensation for pain, suffering and loss of amenity (PSLA) in minor whiplash claims. Other measures included in the consultation were: \r\n•\tan alternative option of a fixed sum for PSLA compensation for minor whiplash claims, rather than removing compensation for PSLA altogether; \r\n•\tthe introduction of a tariff of compensation payments for PSLA for those with more significant injuries; and \r\n•\ta ban on offers to settle claims without medical evidence.\r\nThe price paid by all motorists from the continuing high number and cost of these ‘minor’ and ‘straightforward’ claims is too great, and it is right for the government to take firm action to reduce the financial burdens on consumers. Whichever option for tackling minor claims is pursued, all claimants will continue to receive compensation for other areas of loss such as the costs of medical treatment or for loss of earnings. Those with more serious injuries will also continue to be entitled to compensation for PSLA, but importantly, following the implementation of these measures, the excessive costs attached to dealing with these claims will be reduced and controlled. \r\n\r\nThe personal injury market has long proven itself to be adaptable and innovative, and it is likely that the industry will continue to provide cost effective services following the implementation of these reforms. The potential impact on solicitors will depend on a number of factors, including the volume of claims and their ability to adapt in response to a rapidly changing market. A full impact assessment which explores these issues in more detail was published alongside the consultation (2).\r\nImplemented as a package, these reforms would end the cycle in which innocent car owners pay higher premiums to cover minor, exaggerated or fraudulent claims by others. The government expects insurers to pass on savings of around £40 per motor policy, and a number of leading insurers have publicly stated that they will pass on all of the savings through lower premiums. \r\n\r\nFigures\r\nDWP Claims Recovery Unit figures show there were around 770,000 road traffic accident claims in 2015/16 (3) compared to 460,000 in 2005/06, of which around 690,000 (90%) are labelled as whiplash or soft tissue neck/back injuries. \r\nThe number and frequency of such claims continues to be too high and government action is needed to tackle this issue and help consumers through lower motor premiums. \r\n\r\n(1)  https://consult.justice.gov.uk/digital-communications/reforming-soft-tissue-injury-claims/supporting_documents/reformingsofttissueinjuryclaimsprocess.pdf \r\n  \r\n(2) https://consult.justice.gov.uk/digital-communications/reforming-soft-tissue-injury-claims/supporting_documents/Whiplash%20Impact%20Assessment%20Dec%202016%20v3.pdf \r\n(3) https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/516771/cases-registered-cru-2014-15.csv/preview \r\n\r\nMinistry of Justice","created_at":"2017-02-20T10:39:32.051Z","updated_at":"2017-02-20T10:39:32.051Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":172393,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/172393.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Force the government to act on the eleven recommendations of the UNCRPD report","background":"As a result of being investigated by a United Nations committee for not fulfilling the terms of the UNCRPD, the government have been found guilty of grave \u0026 systematic violations of the rights of disabled people as a direct result of austerity policies introduced into welfare \u0026 social care.","additional_details":"A UN report says a range of measures including controversial cuts to disability benefits, social care budgets \u0026 the introduction of the bedroom tax, have disproportionately \u0026 adversely affected the rights of disabled people to live independently, to work \u0026 achieve an adequate standard of living.\r\n\r\nIt makes 11 recommendations, including calling on the government to carry out a study of the cumulative impact of all spending cuts on the disabled \u0026 to ensure human rights of disabled people are upheld","state":"open","signature_count":17955,"created_at":"2016-11-13T16:23:57.251Z","updated_at":"2017-04-22T23:51:33.498Z","open_at":"2016-11-17T17:46:27.931Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":"2017-02-13T13:53:04.331Z","scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2016-11-13T18:56:37.290Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2017-01-28T22:24:44.980Z","creator_name":"Simon Hywood","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"This Government engaged fully with the inquiry process. However, we strongly reject the findings and believe that the core intentions of many of the recommendations are already being fulfilled.","details":"This Government engaged fully with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (the Convention) inquiry process. In their report, the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (the Committee) expressed appreciation for our support throughout the process, which included facilitating a visit to the UK and providing written evidence on numerous occasions.\r\n\r\nOn receipt of the report, we considered the findings alongside our own evidence. In making this comparison, it was clear that there were individual facts in the report that were incorrect. Additionally, the report failed to place the reforms investigated in the wider context of improvements made and the support available. For example, in discussing Article 27 ‘Work and Employment’, the report barely mentions the raft of work-related support available to disabled people and therefore presents a highly partial view.\r\n\r\nThe UK supported the development of the Convention and was among the first countries to sign it in 2007. Our approach to disability equality, which focuses on inclusion and mainstreaming (with additional support provided as necessary) and on involving disabled people in decision-making, is very much aligned with the Convention. The report itself recognised that “at a national level, it appears that the welfare system together with a social and health care system provide a solid base for the protection of the rights of persons with disabilities and that the system has allowed persons with disabilities to achieve an acceptable level of autonomy and\r\nDWP E-Petitions Response independence”. It also recognised measures to reinforce choice and control in the UK through the increased personalisation and localisation of services.\r\n\r\nThis Government considered the recommendations made by the Committee. Many of the recommendations promote approaches and actions that we already take, such as actively engaging disabled people in policy design and delivery. Others promote actions that the UK Government has already identified as areas for improvement; the Government response sets out some of the work being done across the UK to ensure progress in these areas, such as increasing the accessibility of information and tackling negative attitudes towards disabled people. Several recommendations are prescriptive in nature, sighting specific methodologies that should be implemented. The UK is committed to meeting its obligations of progressing towards the full participation and inclusion of disabled people in all aspects of life on an equal basis. However, how we ensure this progression remains for the UK Government, and the wider parliament, to decide.\r\n\r\nThe UK is a strong parliamentary democracy, where the voices and opinions of disabled people are represented and listened to, and disabled people’s rights are respected, promoted and upheld. It is also a world leader in disability issues. We are proud of the work we do to support people with disabilities and health conditions, both domestically and abroad. And we believe that the core intentions of the recommendations are already incorporated into UK policies and practices, and delivered in a way that fits with the values and structures particular to the UK.\r\n\r\nHowever, we do recognise that there is more to do to meet the Convention’s ambition of full participation and inclusion, and this Government is committed to continuing progress towards this. Taking employment as an example, our aspiration is for disabled people to get the same opportunities as others to find work while ensuring that people who cannot work because of a disability or health condition receive the support they need. That is why this Government is committed to, and working towards, halving the disability employment gap. The ‘Improving Lives’ Green Paper seeks views on how to ensure that health and welfare systems support people who can work with better opportunities to stay in employment, while protecting people who can’t work, with a view to meeting the Government’s ambition.\r\n\r\nThis Government champions work because of its power to transform people’s lives. We strongly believe that, though welfare provides necessary social protection, it is not the only way to help disabled people live independent, inclusive lives in which they can fulfil their potential. Implementing the Convention articles requires more than higher welfare payments. It requires society-wide shifts in attitudes and behaviours, innovative approaches to health provision, and concerted efforts to break down persistent barriers preventing disabled people from living independently, working, and enjoying full inclusion in their communities. This Government remains committed to working across government and sectors to ensure that these changes take place, supporting disabled people in the UK to fully participate in all aspects of life on an equal basis.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions","created_at":"2017-02-13T13:53:04.328Z","updated_at":"2017-02-13T13:53:04.328Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":185421,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/185421.json"},"attributes":{"action":"I would like non-halal meat in all chain restaurants \u0026 for halal to be labelled.","background":"I recently went to a restaurant that claimed to sell non-halal meat however i later on i found out they were selling only halal meat.

","details":"There are four fields of nursing:  adult, child, mental health and learning disability.  The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) regulates nurses and midwives in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The NMC exists to protect the public. It sets standards of education, training, conduct and performance so that nurses and midwives can deliver high quality healthcare throughout their careers.\r\n\r\nBetween now and 2020 the NMC is delivering a programme of change for education, to ensure that new nurses and midwives are safe, skilled and confident when working across a health and care system that is changing at an unprecedented rate. \r\n\r\nThe NMC’s programme of work in 2016–2017 includes: \r\n-the development of new, outcome-based standards of proficiency for the future graduate registered nurse, led by Professor Dame Jill MacLeod Clark; \r\n-the development of an education framework setting out the requirements for institutions and placement partners seeking to deliver approved nursing and midwifery education programmes;\r\n-an independent review of NMC’s quality assurance function, and\r\n-a review of the standards for medicines management, prescribing and return to practice.\r\n\r\nThe development of new standards of proficiency for the future graduate registered midwife will begin in earnest from April 2017, led by Professor Mary Renfrew, from the University of Dundee. This timeline allows the NMC to maintain their  focus on the proposed legislative changes to the way in which midwives are supervised and regulated. \r\n\r\nStandards of competence for the future registered nurse \r\n\r\nIt is clear that there is a need to move towards standards of proficiency for the future registered nurse which are clearer and more consistent, and which sufficiently equip nurses of the future by focussing on outcomes. \r\nThe new standards of proficiency will reflect the growing need for nurses to:\r\n1.1\twork flexibly across care settings and across mental and physical health within multidisciplinary teams;\r\n1.2\tunderstand all stages of the life course, including children and young people, adults, older people, people with mental health issues, and people with intellectual disabilities;\r\n1.3\tfocus on person-centred care; \r\n1.4\tfocus on moving care into the community;\r\n1.5\ttake on more complex roles and increasing leadership responsibilities;\r\n1.6\tbe digitally literate and move towards embedding technology within health; and\r\n1.7\tfocus on a growing public health and wellbeing agenda; and\r\n\r\nThese new standards will apply to all four fields of nursing, on the basis of extensive feedback that we need to ensure all nurses, regardless of field, are prepared with the requisite skills and knowledge to work across a range of nursing contexts and settings into the future. The specific programme requirements contained within the NMC’s education framework will set out what is required of programmes leading to registration within each field.\r\n\r\nThe four fields of nursing are currently set out in legislation and any changes to these fields would require the Privy Council to approve a change to NMC’s legislation. This would involve a full public consultation as well as support from the Department of Health and parliamentary approval. \r\n\r\nThe NMC will be holding a full public consultation on the new nursing standards in the summer, and there are no plans to include changes to the current four fields in this consultation.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2017-03-10T13:34:12.629Z","updated_at":"2017-03-10T13:34:12.629Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":176672,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/176672.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Honour pension protections for nuclear workers.","background":"When companies in the nuclear sector were privatised, employees were granted statutory pension protections.

The NDA Estate Employers are consulting workforces on pension reform, after which Ministers will consider the results.","details":"The Government understands the concerns of the workforce across the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority estate about public sector pension reform, bearing in mind the existence of statutory pension protections.. The Government is supportive of the decommissioning programme and has allocated £11 billion of taxpayer funding over the 2015 Spending Review period, which recognises the vital work the workforce delivers on decommissioning, while maintaining the priority of safe and secure operations. The NDA has also been set a challenging programme of over £1 billion of efficiencies and savings for this period, part of which must come from the reform of two final salary defined benefit pension schemes within the NDA estate.\r\n\r\nGovernment policy on public sector pensions follows from recommendations made the Independent Public Service Pensions Commission’s report in 2011. The main recommendation is to reform final salary, defined benefit schemes in favour of Career Averaged Revalued Earnings schemes (CARE). The aim is to make the current and future costs of public sector pensions fairer between scheme members and other taxpayers and put them on an affordable and sustainable footing. Recommendations were enacted through the provisions of the Public Services Pension Act 2013.\r\n\r\nThe majority of public sector schemes have been reformed already. The Government have set a deadline of April 2018 to reform remaining public sector schemes, including those within the NDA estate and to be guided by the previous reforms. The NDA estate, which receives the majority of its funding from the public purse is classified as public sector by the Office of National Statistics and therefore within scope for pension reform. The ONS determines whether a body falls within the public sector by reference to objective criteria – based upon whether the governance, funding, ownership and function of these bodies demonstrate that they are controlled by government.\r\n\r\nThe two defined benefit pension schemes in scope for reform across the NDA estate cover approximately 10,800 employees and are closed to new members. Since 2006 new starters have been offered membership to a defined contribution pension scheme, which is out of scope for reform.\r\n \r\nGovernment acknowledges that CARE reform would require amendments to statutory pension protections, put in place at the time of privatisation of the electricity sector in the 1980s and the Energy Act 2004, when the NDA was formed. These protections sought to provide pension benefits for existing scheme members that were at least as good as those they were receiving in the public sector.\r\n\r\nThe Government has worked with the NDA in considering how best to implement pension reform and the NDA has held discussions with the trade unions on the potential for non-legislative options as an alternative to CARE to realise the required savings. This would be a bespoke solution to the NDA estate and in effect would leave the statutory protections in place. Consideration has focussed on a cap on pensionable pay, which would apply a reduction in pension schemes costs, by limiting an individual’s final salary used to calculate retirement benefits.\r\n\r\nThe NDA consultation document launched on 9th January sets out the details of two options (CARE and a pensionable pay cap) and seeks views from its workforce by the close of the consultation on 10th March. The consultation is the opportunity for the workforce and trade unions to make their views known so that they can be fully taken into account before any final decisions are made. The Government would therefore encourage the workforce and trade unions to engage constructively in the consultation process, after which the NDA will share the feedback from it with Government for its consideration.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy","created_at":"2017-01-31T17:06:27.616Z","updated_at":"2017-01-31T17:06:27.616Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":188594,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/188594.json"},"attributes":{"action":"A total outright ban of fox hunting","background":"I am asking you to please sign my petition to stop any killing, hunting and hurting of foxes in the UK.

It is important to remember that the pressures faced by the NHS are common to most developed health systems and are due to, amongst other things, an ageing population, changing public expectations and the cost of new drugs. However we have more doctors, more nurses, more paramedics all delivering more treatments than ever, funded by a budget at record levels.\r\n\r\nThe NHS and wider health system has already examined what needs to be done to ensure the sustainability of the health and care system. This is why in the Spending Review in November 2015, the Government committed to increase funding for the NHS in England, with funding to be £10 billion higher in real terms by 2020-21, compared to 2014-15. This is the money that the NHS in England asked for and will support the NHS’s own plan for its future – the Five Year Forward View – which set out what needs to change and how this can be achieved of this new funding. £6 billion will be provided by the end of this year, kick starting the process of change, and enabling the Government to deliver Government objectives including seven day services and improved access to cancer treatments and mental health services. The Five Year Forward View is available on NHS England’s website – https://www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/5yfv-web.pdf. \r\n\r\nWe are making progress towards strategic system changes and new models of care. There is emerging evidence that the vanguards have had a significant impact, reducing pressure on busy services at local level since their launch. In the Fylde Coast Local Health Economy vanguard for example, early figures show that bringing different health professionals under one roof to support older patients with multiple conditions reduced A\u0026E attendance by 13%. We will continue to support this work to design a world class health system, fit for the future.\r\n\r\nAlongside this, we are giving local authorities access of up to £3.5 billion of new support for social care by 2019-20, through the social care precept and the Better Care Fund. And aware of the more imminent pressures on social care, the Government took the necessary steps in the recent Local Government Settlement to help in the shorter-term, making available almost £900 million of additional social care funding over the next two years.\r\n\r\nThe Government believes that the answer to the challenges faced by the health and social care system lies in delivering more integrated services and keeping people well and independent for longer, and in working with the NHS in implementing its own plan for the future of the NHS – the Five Year Forward View.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2017-02-14T11:31:05.292Z","updated_at":"2017-02-14T11:31:05.292Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":174713,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/174713.json"},"attributes":{"action":"This petition calls for a total ban on the use of packs of hounds for hunting","background":"Fox hunting has been banned for a number of years.

This involves ensuring they are taught about relationships and sex at the appropriate age to allow them to navigate the modern world. We are not introducing mandatory sex education for children in primary schools.\r\n\r\nThere has, however, been a range of misreporting of our proposals in the press which, in some cases, may have misled readers/viewers to believing that our proposals are not age appropriate and that we are removing parents’ rights. We would therefore like to present the facts around our proposals as part of our response to this petition.\r\n\r\nOn 1 March 2017, the Government put forward legislation proposing the introduction of the new subject of ‘relationships education’ in primary schools and renaming the secondary school subject to ‘relationships and sex education’, to emphasise the central importance of relationships. The focus in primary school will be on building healthy relationships and staying safe. As children get older and progress in to secondary education, it is important that they start to develop their understanding of healthy adult relationships in more depth, with sex education delivered in that context.\r\n\r\nThere have been many calls for statutory relationships and sex education from leading parent representative bodies such as Mumsnet and PTA UK. A recent Barnardo’s poll of 11-15 year olds also showed that 74% believed that children would be safer if they had age appropriate classes on relationships and sex education. Many teaching unions have also called for statutory status. We therefore feel that it is important that we enhance the quality and availability of these subjects to help equip pupils with the suitable knowledge and skills they need to stay safe and to develop positive, healthy relationships.\r\n\r\nRecognising the rights of parents to teach about sensitive issues in line with their values, we have committed to maintaining that parents have a right to withdraw their child from sex education within relationships and sex education. This excludes the anatomical and biological aspects of sex and reproduction which are currently taught in the National Curriculum as part of science.\r\n\r\nThere will not be a right to withdraw from relationships education in primary schools. This is because we expect that Relationships Education in primary schools will focus on important themes such as friendships, family relationships, managing feelings and dealing with strangers. We believe that these themes are suitable for all children and that they should know and understand them. We will ensure the subjects are carefully designed to safeguard and support pupils.\r\n\r\nAs part of our regulations and statutory guidance for schools, the Department for Education intends to conduct thorough and wide-ranging engagement on the subjects – considering subject content, school practice and quality of delivery. This will engage with, and seek evidence from, schools and teachers; parents and pupils; experts in safeguarding and child wellbeing; subject experts; faith groups; voluntary organisations and other interested parties. \r\n\r\nThe safety of children is our top priority. We expect all schools to ensure that the materials and teaching resources they use are appropriate, and that they comply with their statutory duty to safeguard children’s’ welfare. Schools are already required to consult with parents about their Relationships and Sex Education programmes. \r\n\r\nWe would encourage the signatories of this petition to express their views through our planned consultation process.

The overwhelming majority carried out their duties with courage, professionalism and integrity. This Government will never forget the debt of gratitude we owe them.\r\n\r\nCriminal investigations and prosecutions are a matter for the police and prosecuting authorities who act independently of government and politicians. The Public Prosecution Service of Northern Ireland has made clear that prosecutions have been brought against a number of individuals - both republican and loyalist - for serious terrorist crimes during the Troubles. \r\n\r\nSo far as our overall approach to these matters is concerned, the Government believes in the rule of law.  Where there is evidence of wrongdoing it is right that this should be investigated and, where the evidence exists, for prosecutions to follow. We do not support amnesties or immunity from prosecution.\r\n\r\nLady Justice Hallett’s report in 2014 into the ‘On The Runs’ scheme made clear that the scheme did not amount to an amnesty or immunity from prosecutions for terrorists.  Suspected terrorists were not handed a ‘get out of jail free card.’ If the current government had been presented with a scheme that amounted to an amnesty, we would have stopped it. The report went on to confirm that the scheme was at an end, and that there was no basis for any reliance on letters received by so-called ‘On The Runs’ under the scheme. This was made very clear publicy by the Government in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nThe Government remains committed to the full and faithful implementation of the legacy bodies in the Stormont House Agreement of December 2014. The Agreement concluded 11 weeks of talks between the UK Government, the five largest political parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the Irish Government. It includes a commitment to establish new legacy institutions, among them a Historical Investigations Unit (HIU) to take forward outstanding investigations into Troubles-related deaths.\r\n\r\nThe HIU will deal with deaths in chronological order. This will ensure terrorist murders, including 185 murders of soldiers, are investigated and any evidential leads pursued. These include the murders of 18 soldiers at Warrenpoint in 1979 and eight in the Ballygawley bus bombing in 1988.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the HIU will effectively do away with the responsibility that the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland have in legacy investigations, freeing up both bodies to focus their time and resource on modern day policing matters. \r\n\r\nIn order to ensure expeditious investigations and to bring an end to investigations into the past, the HIU will be time-limited, with an objective to complete its work in 5 years and specific obligations governing the extent to which a case requires further investigation.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the current investigatory mechanisms, the new institutions will be required in legislation to operate in ways that are balanced, proportionate, transparent, fair and equitable. They will be victim-centred but also include statutory controls on the way that they operate, such as time-limits, strictly defined remits and safeguards to protect national security. These measures aim to bring to a close investigations into the past and enable victims and survivors a degree of closure.\r\n\r\nNorthern Ireland Office","created_at":"2017-02-24T15:18:57.684Z","updated_at":"2017-02-24T15:18:57.684Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":176687,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/176687.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Delay triggering Article 50 until after voters vote on the UK EU Exit Package.","background":"The UK shouldn't be forced to leave the EU on terms nobody voted for.

We are proud of our role in creating the State of Israel. The task now is to encourage moves towards peace.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration was written in a world of competing imperial powers, in the midst of the First World War and in the twilight of the Ottoman Empire.  In that context, establishing a homeland for the Jewish people in the land to which they had such strong historical and religious ties was the right and moral thing to do, particularly against the background of centuries of persecution.  Of course, a full assessment of the Declaration and what followed from it can only be made by historians.\r\n\r\nMuch has happened since 1917. We recognise that the Declaration should have called for the protection of political rights of the non-Jewish communities in Palestine, particularly their right to self-determination. However, the important thing now is to look forward and establish security and justice for both Israelis and Palestinians through a lasting peace. We believe the best way to achieve this is through a two-state solution: a negotiated settlement that leads to a safe and secure Israel living alongside a viable and sovereign Palestinian state, based on the 1967 borders with agreed land swaps, Jerusalem as the shared capital of both states, and a just, fair, agreed and realistic settlement for refugees.\r\n\r\nWe believe that such negotiations will only succeed when they are conducted between Israelis and Palestinians, but with appropriate support from the international community. We remain in close consultation with both sides and international partners to encourage meaningful bilateral negotiations.

It has boosted our ability to compete in global markets and helped to make us world leaders in many sectors. The UK remains open to the brightest and best that our companies need to grow, but we also need to take steps to reduce net migration to sustainable levels. It is now more important than ever that we have the right skills domestically to build a strong and competitive economy and it is right that employers look first to the resident UK workforce before recruiting from overseas. \r\n\r\nAs part of our reforms to the visa work routes, we consulted in 2011 on being more selective about those workers who are allowed to settle in the UK. We do not believe there should be an automatic link between coming to work in the UK temporarily and staying permanently.\r\n\r\nThe £35,000 earnings threshold was set following consultation with the Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), an independent advisory body consisting of expert labour market economists – and was equivalent to the median pay of the UK population in skilled jobs which qualified for Tier 2 at the time of the consultation. The MAC carried out a further public consultation, in addition to that carried out by the Government, before arriving at its recommendations.  \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Tier 2 category is to support the UK economy. The MAC advised that the strongest indicator of economic value is salary, and therefore those migrants earning more than a given amount at the end of their temporary leave in the UK should be eligible for settlement. \r\n\r\nStaffing of our hospitals and care homes is a priority. That is why within Tier 2, there are exemptions for non-EEA migrants who are working in a recognised shortage occupation. Nurses, several other healthcare professionals and some teachers are among the jobs which are included on the Shortage Occupation List (SOL). This means that all nurses currently sponsored in Tier 2 will be exempt from the £35,000 threshold when they apply for settlement, even if nurses are removed from the SOL in future.  It is also why in our most recent changes to Tier 2, which came into effect on 6 April 2017, we have put in place transitional arrangements for public sector organisations recruiting through Tier 2, providing them with relief from meeting the minimum salary thresholds for two years until July 2019. \r\n\r\nWorkers who cannot meet the threshold can extend their stay in Tier 2 up to a maximum of six years, and can apply to switch into any other immigration routes for which they are eligible.\r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2017-04-21T15:23:46.751Z","updated_at":"2017-04-21T15:23:46.751Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":171378,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/171378.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Fund Research into Ehlers Danlos Syndrome","background":"EDS is a debilitating and often life threatening conditions, there is very little research and we are a long way off a cure, we need research.","additional_details":"","state":"open","signature_count":13247,"created_at":"2016-11-04T22:02:04.643Z","updated_at":"2017-04-22T22:20:47.093Z","open_at":"2016-11-07T18:30:22.842Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":"2017-03-14T14:48:42.129Z","scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2016-11-04T22:17:53.981Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2017-03-04T23:16:38.082Z","creator_name":"Natasha Brooker","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"The Government recognises the need to support research into rare diseases including Ehlers Danlos Syndrome and is committed to the implementation of the UK Strategy for Rare Diseases.","details":"Ehlers Danos Syndrome (EDS) includes a complex group of rare disorders caused by changes in genes that weaken the connective tissues.  At least seven sub-types of the condition are recognised and the way patients are affected can vary significantly.  The most common features of EDS are joints with an increased range of movement or hypermobility and skin that is unusually stretchy or fragile.  In some the symptoms may be relatively mild but others they are highly disabling and on rare occasions potentially life-threatening.  The complexity of the syndrome and the difficulty in diagnosing the milder forms of the condition means that an accurate estimate of the number of affected individuals is difficult.  The most common form of the condition is believed to affect around 1 in 2000 individuals.  \r\n\r\nThe Government is committed to improving the lives of patients and their families affected by rare diseases including EDS.  To address the particular issues faced by patients with rare conditions the Government has developed the UK Strategy for Rare Diseases.  This Strategy, published in 2013, contains 51 commitments which all four countries of the UK have agreed to implement by 2020.  The recommendations include establishing clearer diagnostic pathways for patients with rare diseases and emphasise the importance of research into the causes and development of treatments for these conditions.\r\n\r\nThe UK continues to be at the forefront of research into rare diseases and 100,000 Genomes Project is actively accelerating progress in the understanding of the genetic basis of rare diseases.  The project applies the latest forms of genetic analyses to patients where the genes involved have not been identified.  Patients with EDS are usually diagnosed by on the basis of their clinical symptoms which can, in some cases, be supported through genetic testing.  In some, but not all cases, there may be a family history of the condition that helps clinicians make a diagnosis.  Diagnosis remains an important issue for EDS patients and genetic basis for the most common form of hypermobile EDS or joint hypermobility syndrome remains unknown.  This is why the 100,000 Genomes Project is recruiting patients with EDS where the genetic basis for the condition remains unknown alongside patients from over other 190 groups of rare conditions.\r\n\r\nThe National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) has significantly invested in rare diseases research and funds a variety of initiatives to support the development of new therapies.  This investment includes the creation of the NIHR Rare Disease Translational Research Collaboration (NIHR RD-TRC).  The NIHR RD-TRC considers the overall biochemical and clinical features of patients with rare conditions.  This approach aims to understand how genetic changes lead to a clinical symptoms of the condition and thereby help to suggest how these conditions can be treated.  The NIHR RD-TRC also plays an important role in training researchers and therefore helps to build the capacity to support future research into rare diseases.  \r\n\r\nThe NIHR also supports the NIHR BioResource that provides a resource of patients that wish to participate in experimental medicine research and are willing to provide clinical information and samples that enable them to be recalled for specific studies.  One study currently supported by the NIHR BioResource concerns an investigation of the genetic basis of rare inherited connective tissue conditions including EDS and closely related conditions.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the Government continues to invest broadly in basic and applied clinical research through the work of the Medical Research Council (MRC) and NIHR.  The MRC portfolio of research includes significant support for both cardiovascular and musculoskeletal disorders that may have implications for research into EDS.  In 2014/15, the MRC provided £20m funding for cardiovascular research and £16m into musculoskeletal research.  Similarly the broad NIHR portfolio of support includes research that may also be relevant to EDS.  In September 2016 a record £816 million investment in NIHR Biomedical Research Centres (BRCs) was awarded to 20 NHS and university partnerships across England that will provide support for 5 years from 1 April 2017.  The NIHR BRCs provide world-class research infrastructure in the NHS to support and enable research funded by NIHR and public, charity and industry research funding partners.  These centres support the development of new, ground-breaking treatments, diagnostics, prevention and care for patients in a wide range of diseases.  \r\n\r\nBoth the MRC and NIHR support research in response to proposals from the academic and clinical community and welcome high quality applications for support into any aspect of human health including EDS.  Applications are judged in open competition with awards being made on the basis of the importance of the topic to patients, value for money and scientific quality.  \r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2017-03-14T14:48:42.126Z","updated_at":"2017-03-14T14:48:42.126Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":171287,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/171287.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Pass law to force employers to pay on time for freelance/contractual work.","background":"Too many times have we all (as freelancers) faced clients that do not pay, or take forever to do so.

That is why we have tightened the rules and are supporting schools and local authorities to use their powers to tackle unauthorised absence.  \r\nDepartment for Education research, published in March 2016, shows that absence has a negative link to attainment; every extra day missed can affect a pupil’s chance of gaining good GCSEs. \r\n\r\nThe Government is focused on reducing absence in schools so that every pupil receives an education that allows them to reach their full potential and create a world-class education system in this country.  This cannot be achieved if the pupil’s education is disrupted by preventable absences.  A child who is absent is also liable to interrupt the education of other pupils and to increase the workload on teachers, as schools seek to ensure that absent pupils catch up with work that has been missed.\r\n\r\nParents have a duty (under section 7 of the Education Act 1996), to ensure that their child of compulsory school age (approximately 5-16) receives an efficient full-time education either by attendance at school or otherwise. \r\n\r\nIn September 2013, the Government clarified the law to ensure that head teachers retained discretion to authorise leave of absence but, in maintained schools, they were only able to do so in exceptional circumstances.  Head teachers know their pupils best and are, therefore, best placed to make those judgments on a case-by-case basis, considering the merits of each request for leave and deciding whether it is exceptional.\r\n\r\nThe clarification of the regulations in 2013 looked to address the widespread misconception that parents were entitled to take their children on holiday during term time.  No such entitlement has ever existed in law.\r\n\r\nThe Government understands that the cost of holidays can be higher outside of term time and we acknowledge that family holidays can be an enriching experience.  The school year is designed to allow families numerous opportunities to enjoy their holiday without disrupting a child’s education.  The Government does not set term and holiday dates.  If parents and schools want different term dates, so they can take their children on holiday outside of the more expensive peak holiday season, they should discuss this with their local authority.\r\n\r\nThe Government has no powers to direct the commercial policy of the travel industry.  In a competitive market it is for business to decide the market worth of their products and to price accordingly.  In the UK holiday market there is fierce competition for custom.  Price rises in peak periods are a reflection of the international competition holiday companies face for hotel accommodation and other services in destinations which are also popular with consumers from many other countries, and where there are limits to capacity.  UK school holidays coincide with summer breaks across Europe and demand for accommodation in the popular destinations is consequently very high during this period.  This increased competition inevitably results in higher costs for the holiday organisers.  It is also the case that many family holidays include extra child-oriented services during the school breaks.  \r\n\r\nThe Government sympathise with parents struggling to afford a holiday but our policy is not to intervene when markets function normally. In a competitive market, prices are inevitably higher during peak periods.\r\n\r\nThe Government has made real progress - overall absence rates have followed a general downward trend since 2006/07 when the overall absence rate was 6.5 percent, with the rate of overall absence in 2014/15 standing at 4.6 per cent.  There are almost 200,000 fewer pupils who are persistently absent since 2010.  \r\n\r\nThe rate of absence due to term time holidays has fallen by more than a third since 2012/13.  This has been driven by a drop in absence due to authorised term time holidays - with 3.4 per cent of pupils missing at least one session due to authorised term time holiday in 2014/15 down from 15.1 per cent in 2012/13. \r\n\r\nThis topic has been debated on a number of occasions in the past.

","details":"The Government considers our Service personnel to be the best in the world, recognising the very difficult job that they have to do and the high standards they are expected to maintain.    \r\n\r\nUK Service personnel are subject to the Armed Forces Act 2006 wherever they are in the world. The Act contains a consistent and fair system of Service law that recognises the unique context within which Service personnel operate and it underpins the maintenance of discipline which is fundamental for operational effectiveness.  The Service Justice System provides for the same crimes as under the law of England and Wales, including theft, rape and murder, and a range of disciplinary offences specific to the military environment, such as failure to obey a lawful command.  When a Service person commits a crime it is essential that justice is done.  \r\n\r\nThere are clear international rules around what is permitted in armed conflict and what actions are prohibited as war crimes, or crimes under UK law. International Law requires the UK to ensure that our Armed Forces are subject to a proper disciplinary system, and to ensure that Service personnel properly understand the law that governs their actions. Violation of criminal law by a Service person can place their colleagues in danger and undermine the legitimacy of the mission. Recognising the difficult circumstances, accountability is a core concept in the law of the UK and this accountability is equally important when it comes to military actions overseas.  \r\n\r\nWhere  Service personnel are following  lawful orders and are properly performing their duties they are not liable to be prosecuted for what might otherwise constitute crimes.  This includes circumstances where there are civilian casualties and other forms of collateral damage. The UK Armed Forces and the Ministry of Defence support the legal and moral obligation to minimise collateral damage. This includes  planning our operations with the benefit of  legal advice, and adherence to stringent rules of engagement. There are clear and well understood boundaries between when a Service person is acting lawfully, within the confines of their role, and when they have gone outside the performance of their role and committed a crime. \r\n\r\nWhere there is evidence of a potential crime, an appropriate police investigation must be carried out. \r\n\r\nAs for the Sergeant Blackman case, this has been the subject of an independent investigation, prosecution and appeal process. It would therefore not be appropriate to comment on this case. The Government is confident however that the legal obligations to which Service personnel are subject to, are clear and appropriate.

There are no plans to introduce a rate specifically for HGV drivers. ","details":"The objective of the National Minimum Wage is to ensure that low income workers are fairly paid. The National Minimum Wage clearly demonstrates the Government’s commitment to protecting those on the lowest incomes, and to making work pay. \r\n\r\nThe National Living Wage was introduced in April 2016 and it specifies the minimum hourly rate that workers aged 25 and over should be paid. The rate is currently set at £7.20 and from April 2017 it will be increased to £7.50. The Government’s objective is for the National Living Wage to equal 60 per cent of median earnings in the UK by 2020. Around 3 million low income workers are expected to benefit directly from the National Living Wage by 2020, and up to 6 million in total could see their pay rise as a result of a knock-on effect of the policy.\r\n \r\nIt is important that Government strikes a balance between setting National Minimum Wage rates which support workers, and on the other hand avoiding rates which are too high and which could lead to an increase in unemployment. The Government achieves this balance by considering the expert advice from the Low Pay Commission (LPC), which is independent of Government and involves representatives from both employer and worker groups. \r\n\r\nThe LPC makes recommendations to the Government on what the National Minimum Wage rates should be, such that there will be no impact on employment levels. The LPC does this by gathering extensive evidence from across the economy including workers, their representatives and employers. The LPC’s recommendation for the National Living Wage rate is calculated slightly differently in that the LPC is asked to recommend the rate such that it reaches 60% of median earnings by 2020. \r\n\r\nPay rates over and above the appropriate National Minimum Wage or Living Wage rate are a matter between employers and workers. It is the responsibility of employers to ensure that their reward packages are competitive, in order to retain and develop the workforces which are fundamental to their success.\r\n\r\nMany employers pay their workers more than the legal minimum, where it is affordable for them to do so. So long as they are paying at least the legal minimum, this is a decision for employers to take. Therefore, the Government has no plans to introduce a higher minimum wage rate specifically for HGV drivers. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy","created_at":"2017-01-04T11:25:53.173Z","updated_at":"2017-01-04T11:25:53.173Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":170843,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/170843.json"},"attributes":{"action":"For the Home Office to hold an inquiry into the battle of Orgreave","background":"Thousands of miners and police clashed at the Yorkshire coking site in 1984.\r\nCampaigners said officers led by South Yorkshire Police were heavy-handed and manufactured statements.\r\n","additional_details":"Calls for an Orgreave inquiry escalated following the conclusion of the two-year Hillsborough inquests, which provided a scathing assessment of the under-fire South Yorkshire Police force's behaviour.\r\nWhat was the 'Battle of Orgreave'?\r\nOrgreave: The battle that's not over\r\nThe statement added: \"The campaigners say that had the consequences of the events at Orgreave been addressed properly at the time, the tragic events at Hillsborough would never have happened five years later.","state":"open","signature_count":12596,"created_at":"2016-11-01T00:24:01.707Z","updated_at":"2017-04-21T07:54:40.959Z","open_at":"2016-11-02T17:45:47.884Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":"2016-11-21T13:54:57.630Z","scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2016-11-01T08:38:44.397Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2016-11-06T19:40:54.968Z","creator_name":"Peter Cooper","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"The Home Secretary announced to Parliament on 31 October her decision not to establish an inquiry or other independent review into the policing of the events at Orgreave.","details":"In making her decision, the Home Secretary carefully considered a submission from the Orgreave Truth and Justice Campaign (OTJC) on the need for an inquiry relating to the policing of events at Orgreave in 1984, and met the OTJC and other campaign supporters (including the then Shadow Home Secretary) on 13 September to discuss their concerns. She acknowledged that it had been a difficult decision to make.\r\n\r\nIn determining whether or not to establish a statutory inquiry or other review, the Home Secretary considered a number of factors, reviewed a range of documents, carefully scrutinized the arguments contained in the Campaign’s submission and spoke to members of the Campaign. She concluded that neither an inquiry nor a review was required to allay public concern, more than 30 years after the events in question. In doing so, she noted the following factors:\r\n\r\n•\tDespite the forceful accounts and arguments provided by the campaigners and former miners who were present that day, about the effect that these events have had on them, ultimately there were no deaths or wrongful convictions.\r\n\r\n•\tIn addition, there have been very significant changes to policing since 1984, at every level, including major reforms to criminal procedure, changes to public order policing and practice, stronger external scrutiny and greater local accountability.\r\n\r\nIn particular the operational delivery and practice of public order policing has moved on a great deal from the arrangements in 1984, and tactics have now been reviewed and altered several times both by the police and the courts.\r\n\r\n•\tProtections which were singularly lacking at the time of Orgreave now exist with the introduction of the Police \u0026 Criminal Evidence Act 1984 which has vastly improved the way police investigations and powers operate.\r\n\r\n•\tThe creation of the Crown Prosecution Service in 1986, with the introduction of independent CPS prosecutors, fundamentally altered the prosecution of offences. It ended the existence of ad hoc prosecution arrangements across the country whereby a mixture of police prosecutors and private firms of solicitors - hired by the police and acting for and on the instruction of the police – conducted prosecutions.\r\n•\tWith regards to the external scrutiny of complaints against the police, this was strengthened by the creation, in 1985, of the Police Complaints Authority which was replaced in 2004 by the more effective Independent Police Complaints Commission and in turn will be replaced by the Office for Police Conduct in 2017. The exemplary standards of behaviour expected of everyone who works in policing were reinforced by the introduction of a statutory Code of Ethics, laid before this House in 2014.\r\n\r\n•\tLastly, the introduction of directly elected Police and Crime Commissioners in 2012 has given the public a voice in shaping their local policing priorities and improved the accountability of police leadership.\r\n\r\nAs a result there would therefore be very few lessons for the policing system today to be learned from any review of the events and practices of three decades ago. This is a very important consideration when looking at the necessity for an inquiry or independent review and the public interest to be derived from holding one. Taking these considerations into account, the Home Secretary does not believe that establishing any kind of inquiry is required in the wider public interest concern or for any other reason.\r\n\r\nThe Home Secretary believes that the focus should now be on continuing to ensure that the policing system is the best it can be for the future, including through reforms currently before Parliament in the Policing and Crime Bill, so that the public can have the best possible policing both in South Yorkshire and across the country.\r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2016-11-21T13:54:57.628Z","updated_at":"2016-11-21T13:54:57.628Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":177076,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/177076.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Approve funding for stem cell transplantation in sickle cell patients","background":"Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is the most common inherited blood disorder in the UK, affecting 15K people, mostly of African/Caribbean descent.

The most serious form is sickle cell anaemia, which is one of the most common forms of inherited genetic conditions. \r\n\r\nSickle cell abnormalities in the haemoglobin, found in red blood cells, cause the blood cells to assume a sickle shape following the release of oxygen. The abnormal shape causes the cells to clump together and can block small blood vessels. This condition can be extremely painful and frequently requires admission to hospital. Patients with sickle cell disease require specialist care throughout their lives that can involve medication and blood transfusions. \r\n\r\nStem cell transplant using donated stem cells can be an effective treatment for some carefully selected patients with sickle cell disease, but is a major treatment with significant risks. The transplantation process involves the eradication of the patient’s immune system and replacing their stem cells with ones that are matched to them with the aim of curing the disease. The process can lead to a number of potentially severe and life-threatening complications.\r\n\r\nChildren with sickle cell disease can be treated with stem cell transplants where other treatment options have proven ineffective and a suitably matched donor is available. Transplants are generally safer in children compared to adults because their immune systems and other body tissues are better able to regenerate and recover quickly following toxic treatments. This means the balance of benefit and risk is significantly different between adults and children. A further complication is that not all patients are able to find a suitably matched donor. Transplants are much more likely to be successful if the donor and patient are as closely matched as possible.  \r\n\r\nStem cell treatment is not currently routinely commissioned by NHS England for adults with sickle cell disease, but commissioning policy is kept under review in the light of the latest clinical evidence. There have been some recent promising results from studies that have investigated the use of less harsh treatments to prepare patients with sickle cell disease for transplantation. However, these approaches are yet to be shown to be both safe and effective. \r\n\r\nThe National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) is currently inviting research proposals for a multicentre randomised control trial to address the clinical and cost effectiveness of stem cell transplantation in adults with severe sickle cell disease. Evidence from this trial will inform NHS England commissioning policy related to stem cell transplants in adults with sickle cell disease.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2017-02-16T17:05:51.910Z","updated_at":"2017-02-16T17:05:51.910Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":178322,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/178322.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Allow 16/17 year olds to vote.","background":"In Year 9 in secondary school we are made to choose our GCSE subjects, at 16 we can smoke, win the lottery have sex, get a job.

Access to supportive services in the crucial early weeks can help women establish and maintain breast feeding successfully. Midwives and Health Visitors have an important role to play in providing information, support and advice to mothers and parents on infant feeding.\r\n\r\nTo assist the NHS, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) considered the division of tongue-tie in depth in July 2004. Current NICE guidelines recommend that, when considering division of tongue-tie, healthcare professionals should be sure that the parents or carers understand what is involved and consent to the treatment, and the results of the procedure are monitored.

This is why improving the access to high quality RSE is a key priority of this government. \r\n\r\nSex Education is currently compulsory in maintained secondary schools and any school teaching it is required to have regard to the Secretary of State's 2000, ‘Sex and Relationship Education guidance’. The current guidance highlights, for example, that ‘Pupils need also to be given accurate information and helped to develop skills to enable them to understand difference and respect themselves and others and for the purpose also of preventing and removing prejudice’.\r\n\r\nSchools also have a duty under the Equality Act (2010) to ensure that LGBT pupils or the children of LGBT parents are not singled out for different and less favourable treatment from that given to other pupils. They should check that there are no practices that could result in unfair, less favourable treatment of such pupils. The Education Act (2002) places duties on schools to offer a balanced and broadly based curriculum that prepares all pupils for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of later life. Schools also have a duty to address homophobic, biphobic and transphobic bullying.\r\n\r\nWe believe that it is for schools to tailor their RSE programme to reflect the needs of all their pupils. Schools have a duty to publish details of their sex education policy, so that parents can engage with this information.\r\n\r\nFurther improving the access to quality RSE is a priority for this government. This is why we have recently introduced an amendment to the Children and Social Work Bill, which commits the Secretary of State to introducing compulsory Relationships Education in all primary schools and Relationships and Sex Education (RSE) in all secondary schools through regulations. \r\n\r\nThis approach will allow us time to properly and thoroughly engage with a wide range of interests and expertise, including those representing LGBTQ+. The outcomes of this engagement will then feed into the development of both the regulations making the subjects statutory, and the guidance that will support schools in delivering high quality Relationships Education and RSE.\r\n\r\nThis approach to making the subjects statutory also, crucially, allows schools time to prepare to deliver the new content from September 2019\r\n\r\nAwareness of HIV and STIs\r\n\r\nPupils are taught about HIV and other STIs during key stage 4 as part of what they are taught about communicable diseases.

This will include a proposal for a coherent approach to determine which professions should be regulated on a statutory footing. \r\n \r\nThe statutory regulation of healthcare professionals should be used proportionately and only where the risks to public and patient protection cannot be addressed in other ways, such as through employer oversight, or accredited voluntary registration.  Measuring the risk posed by any particular group of professionals is not easy; particularly in healthcare where professionals face complex situations on a regular basis. Establishing clear criteria to assess the appropriate level of oversight will bring consistency to the decision-making process, helping to ensure that patients and the public receive the right level of protection without placing unnecessary burdens on front line staff or financial burdens on registrants.\r\n\r\nIt is expected a clear model could be used to determine the appropriate form of regulation for all professional groups, including those which are currently subject to statutory regulation, new and emerging professions and existing professions that are not regulated.  The Professional Standards Authority has set out proposals for assessing which professional groups should be regulated. It has proposed a two stage assessment and views will be sought on this as part of the consultation.  \r\n\r\n\r\nOccupational groups including nutritionist that are not subject to statutory regulation may consider joining a voluntary register. The Professional Standards Authority (PSA) accredits those registers that meet its quality standards.  This provides patients, the public and employers with assurance about the standards and competence of registrants.

There are risks of implantation, such as infection, inappropriate shocks etc. so it is rarely the case that all people with a certain condition should have an ICD. It is usually that those at sufficient risk of an arrhythmia will have this recommended and those at low risk may not. \r\n\r\nTherefore, it is a matter for the responsible clinician to discuss with the patient the risks and benefits of different interventions.
