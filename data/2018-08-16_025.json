Now the people of Tawergha have built make-shift camps in Gararat Al-Gadaf which is near Bin Walid and Harawa which is near Sirte. On 5/02/2018 militias from Mistrata attacked the camp and burned some tents. On 12/02/2018 two people passed away and some children were admitted to Bin Walid hospital due to exposure to the cold. I am asking the British Government to provide assistance to these civilians.","state":"open","signature_count":18,"created_at":"2018-02-13T21:38:13.756Z","updated_at":"2018-07-11T00:20:31.419Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-02-23T11:59:56.053Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-02-13T21:58:50.330Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"T Hussain","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":212772,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/212772.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Set a legal maximum stake of £2 for fixed odds betting machines (FOBTS)","background":"Problem gamblers are often troubled, vulnerable and in self-destruct mode.
