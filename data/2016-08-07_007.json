Broadband connects businesses and individuals to the trade routes of the 21st century and Portugal, Denmark, Germany, France and Italy all outstrip the UK in deploying fibre to the property. This must change if the UK economy is to thrive.","state":"open","signature_count":1589,"created_at":"2016-02-25T11:13:56.770Z","updated_at":"2016-08-05T04:50:12.219Z","open_at":"2016-02-25T14:08:24.427Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2016-02-25T12:06:16.365Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"creator_name":"Graham Long","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":138621,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/138621.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Allow britain as a whole to vote for our capital londons mayor","background":"We think as a nation who now is independent should have a say on who is made our capitals mayor the whole of britain should vote in for our capitals mayor ","additional_details":"Only london votes for the capitals mayor and we britain should have a say as it is our capital not just a city or town ","state":"open","signature_count":1564,"created_at":"2016-06-25T12:27:35.270Z","updated_at":"2016-08-06T12:45:17.754Z","open_at":"2016-07-05T11:47:34.071Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2016-06-25T14:50:21.749Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"creator_name":"Stephen burgess","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":161119,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/161119.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Petition the MOD to collect the statistics for Suicide rates amongst UK Veterens","background":"Reports have indicated that 22 US Armed Forces Veterans commit suicide every day and this has been linked to undiagnosed PTSD from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
