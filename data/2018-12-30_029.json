As parents and carers we have a duty to our children.\r\n\r\nThe petition is aimed to try to implement a law that states that no child under the age of 13 should be left alone at any given time, the reason for this is due to safeguarding and putting a huge responsibility on children regardless of their mental age. We are not allowed to leave children alone overnight and the same rules must apply throughout the day too. I understand a child must be given due responsibility but under the age of 13 should not be allowed due to risks and safety.","state":"open","signature_count":11,"created_at":"2018-10-05T21:03:06.130Z","updated_at":"2018-11-20T11:53:18.565Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-10-15T16:14:06.141Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-10-06T17:14:18.947Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Paul Hulse","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":229563,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/229563.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make the NHS exempt from paying business rates.","background":"NHS Hospitals are facing rising business rates whilst private hospitals are able to register as a charity saving them around 80% on their business rates.","additional_details":"","state":"open","signature_count":11,"created_at":"2018-09-30T09:35:34.408Z","updated_at":"2018-11-18T16:43:41.701Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-10-08T10:01:44.747Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-10-01T12:08:02.593Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Jan Orbell","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":229452,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/229452.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Urge Bank of England to return to traditional 'paper' banknotes","background":"Keep existing 'paper* £20 \u0026 £50 and recall existing polymer notes.
