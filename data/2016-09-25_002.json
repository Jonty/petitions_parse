Payments will be made as usual. Access after we leave the EU will be considered in the post-Article 50 negotiations.","details":"As with other EU programmes our future engagement will be a matter for the negotiations which will follow triggering Article 50. As we conduct our negotiations, it must be a priority to regain more control of the numbers of people who come here from Europe - but also to allow British companies to trade with the single market in goods and services. We are about to begin these negotiations and it would be wrong to set out further specific positions in advance. At every step of these negotiations we will work to ensure the best possible outcome for the British people. Ministers are listening to the concerns raised by the academic community, students and parents. While we remain in the EU we retain all our rights and obligations as a Member State, including the right to participate in Erasmus. \r\n\r\nFor students, international mobility can help enhance their communication skills, confidence and employability. International and cross cultural experience and communication skills are valued by employers. HE institutions also benefit from increasing the mobility of their student population.  As well as improving the employability of their graduates, mobility periods enhance the overall student experience the institution is able to offer prospective students, making them more competitive in terms of the students they can attract.  Furthermore, increasing student exchanges with institutions abroad can contribute to the institution’s overall internationalisation strategy – leading to greater research collaboration between academics, for example, and improving the global reputation of the institution.  Because we value these benefits the Government is supporting a sector led UK strategy for Outward Mobility, which aims to increase the number of UK students who access international placements as part of their degree programmes. (http://www.go.international.ac.uk/go-abroad.) To support such mobility students on the EU Erasmus scheme for a full year abroad have their tuition fees capped at 15% of the permitted level for their institution in the year they spend abroad, and are entitled to an additional tuition fee loan to cover this. Their institutions receive a HEFCE grant of £2,250 per student for that year in addition to the 15% fee from the student. These 'fee waiver' arrangements also apply to those going abroad to study, but not work, under other mobility schemes.  \r\n\r\nErasmus (European Action Scheme for the Mobility of University Students) began in 1986 and its popularity is such that it has given its name to the entire EU education, training youth and sport programme, 'Erasmus+', which runs from 2014-20, and which provides funding for the specific Erasmus HE mobility scheme. It enables university students at all levels to undertake study or work placements in another EU country, or certain others (the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Turkey) as part of their course.  The minimum placement period under the scheme is three months, or two for work placements, and the maximum one year. It is currently the largest single such student mobility scheme for UK students; in 2013/14 there were 15,566 Erasmus placements in Europe. The vast majority of outgoing Erasmus students are undergraduates, and a little less than half are studying languages. In 2012/13 27,147 European students undertook a placement in the UK. It is up to individual institutions to decide how many students they send and receive.\r\n\r\nThe scheme is administered in the UK by the Erasmus+ National Agency, which receives funding from the EU Erasmus+ programme to fund outgoing students (the Government pays the Agency a management fee to cover the administrative costs). Students receive a non-means tested grant of between €250 and €400 per month whilst abroad, depending on which country they visit. Premiums of €100 per month are paid to all on work placements and to those on study placements qualifying as disadvantaged students.  Additional help from EU funding is available for those with special needs.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education","created_at":"2016-09-19T10:43:42.751Z","updated_at":"2016-09-19T10:43:42.751Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":130787,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/130787.json"},"attributes":{"action":"End the contracts with Atos, Capita and maximus as they are not fit for purpose.","background":"I and many other vulnerable people are getting wrongly assessed by Atos, Capita and Maximus they dont listen to what you have to say also they can be intimidating and contradict what doctors and hospital consultants say also they dont take complaint seriously, there putting lives at risk with lies.","additional_details":"I have 2 letters stating the assessment report was good and up to standards but after fighting the complaint the 3rd letter now states the assessment report for PIP was up to standards and the nurse was contradicting herself and the report needs amending as it could affect the decision but because i won a appeal they wont tell DWP but the contacts needs ending with theses companies as they're not fit for purpose and GPs should have more of a say whether you can or can't work.","state":"open","signature_count":13307,"created_at":"2016-05-18T16:05:43.890Z","updated_at":"2016-09-24T23:22:47.725Z","open_at":"2016-05-27T09:49:25.300Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":"2016-09-13T14:38:51.303Z","scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2016-05-18T16:18:33.559Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2016-08-30T14:47:15.739Z","creator_name":"Jamie Brown","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"We are committed to ensuring claimants receive high quality, objective, fair and accurate assessments and closely monitor all aspects of the process including the performance of Assessment Providers.","details":"The Department is committed to protecting the most vulnerable people in society and is determined to support more people into work and provide individuals who cannot work with the correct support that they need – the effective assessment of people’s abilities is key to this goal. \r\n\r\nHealth and disability assessments require specialist skills, which is why the Department contracts to have them undertaken by qualified healthcare professionals.\r\n\r\nThe role of our Assessment Providers is to carry out health and disability assessments on behalf of the DWP. Our providers are committed to providing a quality, sensitive and respectful service by conducting fair, accurate and objective assessments. DWP closely and robustly monitors the performance of all our contracted providers.  \r\n\r\nAssessments undertaken by our contracted providers consider the impact a health condition or disability has on an individual, rather than providing a diagnosis or treatment plan and therefore the role undertaken by our contracted healthcare professionals is quite different to the role carried out by a GP. \r\n\r\nAll healthcare professionals undertaking assessments on behalf of DWP are registered practitioners who have also met requirements around training, experience and competence. \r\nTheir approach should allow an individual the time they need to describe the impact of their health condition or disability in their own words. Healthcare professionals adopt a holistic approach, assessing all the evidence available to them, including their clinical knowledge, to provide a report to DWP Decision Makers. The decision maker will then take into consideration all available evidence, including evidence received from the claimant, reports from GPs, hospital doctors and other clinicians in addition to the assessment report, to determine a person’s eligibility for benefit. \r\n\r\nDWP has also put in place an independent audit of assessments to ensure that the advice provided to the Department's decision makers is of suitable quality, fully explained and justified. In addition, there are other safeguards in place to ensure correct decisions are made, such as DWP decision makers being able to ask the provider for clarification or advice or returning the report to the provider if they believe that it does not provide sufficient information for them to make a decision.\r\n\r\nDWP also has a range of other policies and procedures in place to help people that may need additional support and if someone has been identified by us as needing further support, we ensure this information is passed on to our contracted provider, who will also endeavour to provide the appropriate support to meet their needs.\r\n\r\nAssessment providers are continually looking at ways to improve the service they provide and work closely with DWP on initiatives to improve the overall customer experience. \r\n\r\nOur providers take complaints very seriously and will fully investigate all complaints received, obtaining all relevant information to inform a balanced, appropriate and full response. \r\n\r\nIf, at the end of the complaint process, an individual remains dissatisfied with the way in which the Assessment Provider has dealt with their complaint, they can escalate their concerns to the Independent Case Examiner, who provides a free complaints review service to people that want to complain about government organisations.\r\n\r\nWe are confident that we have the right Assessment Providers in place to deliver our health and disability assessments and that we have a strong contract management and operational monitoring regime in place that enables us to robustly monitor the performance of these contracted providers.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions","created_at":"2016-09-13T14:38:51.300Z","updated_at":"2016-09-13T14:38:51.300Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":125827,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/125827.json"},"attributes":{"action":"The repeal of  the code on farming chickens for meat + farming should be debated","background":"The Government plans to scrap  the code on farming chickens for meat and breeding.","additional_details":"The proposed Government amendments or downgrading of animal welfare standards (scheduled to commence on 27 April 2016) i.e the repealing of statutory codes on farm animal welfare, including: \r\n\r\n1. the scrapping of the official code on farming chickens for meat and breeding; and \r\n2. the proposed move to \" industry-led” guidance,\r\n\r\nmay reasonably be seen as significantly posing the risk of: \r\n\r\n(A) reducing animal welfare standards; and \r\n(B) negatively impacting on consumer safety and public health,\r\n\r\nand, as such, should be debated in, and be the subject of, legislation passed by the UK Parliament before being implemented.","state":"open","signature_count":13039,"created_at":"2016-03-26T04:10:32.035Z","updated_at":"2016-09-21T23:54:38.131Z","open_at":"2016-03-31T11:33:33.001Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":"2016-04-14T13:01:15.563Z","scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2016-03-26T09:10:10.552Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2016-04-05T20:45:25.141Z","creator_name":"David Walker","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"The Government intends to retain the statutory codes.

The latter provides for public service pensions to be uprated at the same time and by the same percentage as the increase in the additional pension provided under the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (SERPS), which has been based on the increase in the CPI since April 2011. Prior to this date the RPI was used rather than the CPI. The underlying purpose of this legislation is to maintain the purchasing power of the additional elements of state retirement pensions and public service pensions. \r\n\r\nThe rationale for the change is as follows:\r\n•\tCPI is the headline measure of inflation used by the Bank of England;\r\n•\tCPI takes better account of how behaviour changes in response to price changes; \r\n•\tCPI also more accurately represents the inflation experience of pensioners and benefit recipients – for example, RPI excludes pensioners who receive a significant proportion of their income from the State (up to 20% of retired households); and\r\n•\tCPI is less volatile – for example, RPI was negative in September 2009 whereas CPI continued to rise.\r\n\r\nThe pension is accrued (or activated) on the basis of current prices.  The uprating of pensions does not apply retrospectively.\r\n\r\nIn response to a legal challenge against this decision the High Court and the Court of Appeal both ruled in the Government's favour, finding that CPI is appropriate for benefits and pensions uprating.\r\n\r\nRPI has also historically experienced periods of negative year on year change, as in 2009 when the uprating of pensions in payment was also frozen.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence","created_at":"2016-05-27T14:26:17.605Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T14:28:05.184Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":128795,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/128795.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Amend the immigration bill to allow 3000 lone child refugees to enter the UK","background":"On Monday 25th April 2016, MPs voted AGAINST amending the bill to allow these stranded children refuge in the UK.

We are looking to transfer children who were already registered in Europe before the EU-Turkey deal came into force on 20 March, where it is in their best interests.\r\n\r\nWe must put the best interests of children first, and avoid any policy that places children at additional risk or encourages them to place their lives in the hands of the people traffickers and criminal gangs.  In any response, we need to be very careful not to inadvertently create a situation in which families see an advantage in sending children ahead, putting their lives at risk by attempting perilous sea crossings to Europe.\r\n\r\nWe will work closely with local authorities. We must ensure we fulfil our obligations to children who are already in UK, as well ensuring we have the right support for those who may be brought to the UK from Europe.\r\n\r\nWe will consult relevant NGOs, UNHCR, UNICEF and Member States on how best we implement this legislation.  The very nature of this amendment means we must take the time to consult others before bringing final proposals on how to implement.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, the UK continues to take a comprehensive approach to the Syria conflict and migration crisis by providing significant aid and assistance; including our resettlement programmes.  On 4 February 2016, the Prime Minister announced that the UK will more than double our total pledge to the Syria crisis from £1.12 billion to over £2.3 billion.  This is our largest ever response to a single humanitarian crisis.  The Syrian Resettlement Scheme has already provided safe haven to more than 1000 vulnerable Syrians – around half of them children - and overall we expect children to make up a significant proportion of the 20,000 resettlement places we are providing to this group.\r\n\r\nAs announced on 21 April, we have worked closely with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to design a resettlement scheme that will protect the most vulnerable children. The new scheme has been designed with the UNHCR to resettle ‘children at risk’ from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.  The Government has committed to resettling several hundred individuals in the first year with a view to resettling up to 3000 individuals over the lifetime of this Parliament, the majority of which will be children, where the UNHCR deem it to be in their best interests. Children who are identified as at risk will be resettled with their family members or carers where appropriate.  There will be a review of the scheme at the two year mark.\r\n\r\nThis unique initiative will be the largest resettlement effort that focuses on children at risk from the MENA region.  The new scheme will be in addition to the Prime Minister’s commitment to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees. It is also in addition to our other existing resettlement schemes. \r\n\r\nIn regards to Europe, we are providing significant assistance to Member States facing particular pressures to ensure that all refugees can have effective access to protection, wherever they are.   The UK is the largest bilateral contributor to the humanitarian response to the crisis in Europe and the Balkans with a total contribution of £65m.  This includes nearly £46 million to provide life-saving aid to migrants and refugees including food, water, hygiene kits and infant packs, and protection for the most vulnerable, as well as support to organisations helping governments build their capacity to manage arrivals in Greece and the Balkans. The efforts of the partners we fund are targeted to reach the most vulnerable - including children.\r\n\r\nIt also includes the £10m Refugee Children Fund the Department for International Development (DFID) has created to support the needs of vulnerable refugee and migrant children specifically in Europe. The fund will support three specialist and mandated organisations UNHCR, Save the Children and the International Rescue Committee to work with host authorities to care for and assist unaccompanied or separated children in Europe and the Balkans. \r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2016-05-12T15:41:46.490Z","updated_at":"2016-05-12T15:41:46.490Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":126346,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/126346.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Legalise cannabis use for adults over 21 years of age..","background":"6 plants/18 seedlings/24 oz useable cannabis per adult.Allow extracts,medibles,topicals to be sold in licensed dispensaries,after being tested in accredited testing facilities.No restrictions of THC content.End prohibition and the failed war on drugs.We're not going away.","additional_details":"Psychotic illness is genetic in nature,not caused by cannabis,as per University of Toronto/Harvard Medical School and is,in fact,treated successfully with cannabis.Cannabis is used as an exit drug to treat alcoholism.Hebrew University in Jerusalem.Raphael Mechoulam, Ph.D of Hebrew University.Colorado,Washington,Oregon,Alaska, Washington DC,et al.The Lancet.JAMA.

Cannabis has the capacity to damage people’s mental and physical health, and harms both individuals and communities. ","details":"The evidence from the Government’s independent experts, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, is that the use of cannabis is a “significant public health issue and can unquestionably cause harm to individuals and society”.  Legalising it would not prevent the crime associated with its production and supply, nor prevent the associated harms to users, their families and wider society. \r\n\r\nLegalisation would wrongly signal that cannabis use is without risk, particularly among those who do not use drugs. It is vital that we prevent people, especially young people, from using drugs in the first place and intervene early with those who do start to develop problems. Making cannabis legal would be counter-productive to this action.\r\n\r\nIndeed legalisation would carry its own administrative and enforcement costs which could be substantial. A system of this kind would continue to require resources from health services, enforcement partners and the criminal justice system to manage wider prescription and dependence treatment costs – including treating health harms of individual users; compliance activity and monitoring activities around production, demand and supply.\r\n\r\nWhere claims are made for medicinal applications, there is a clear regime in place, administered by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The regime enables medicines (including those containing controlled drugs) to be developed, licensed and made available for medicinal use to patients in the UK. For example, the cannabis-based medicine ‘Sativex’ has been granted marketing authorisation in the UK by the MHRA for the treatment of spasticity due to multiple sclerosis. Sativex was rigorously tested for its safety and efficacy before receiving approval. \r\n\r\nThe MHRA is open to considering marketing approval applications for other medicinal cannabis products should a product be developed. As happened in the case of Sativex in 2010, the Home Office will consider issuing a licence to enable trials of any new medicine providing it complies with appropriate ethical approvals.\r\n\r\nThe Government continues to take action to prevent the harms caused by drug use – from educating young people about the risks to helping dependent individuals through treatment, and supporting law enforcement in tackling the illicit trade.

To assist the handling of such cases, the two Governments have established a permanent official contact group, agreed single points of contact within respective Dublin Units and a UK asylum expert was seconded to the French administration to facilitate the improvement of all stages of the process.  The UK and France are running regular joint communication campaigns in northern France which inform unaccompanied children and others of their right to claim asylum in France. \r\n\r\nBetween the start of January 2016 and 2 July 2016, our records indicate that the UK has accepted over 50 requests from France under the Dublin Regulation to take charge of asylum seeking children on family grounds of which more than 40 have already been transferred to the UK.

Over 20 children who meet the criteria in the Immigration Act have been accepted for transfer to the UK since Royal Assent in May, the majority of whom have already arrived in the UK. As is required by the Immigration Act 2016, we are consulting with local authorities to confirm available capacity and to ensure appropriate support systems are in place. We are in active discussions with the UNHCR, UNICEF, NGOs and the Italian, Greek and French governments to strengthen and speed up mechanisms to identify, assess and transfer children who meet the criteria to the UK where this in their best interests.\r\n\r\nWe have always been clear that we want to support family reunification as much as possible. It is important to use the tools available to help children reunite with family wherever possible. We will prioritise cases with family links to the UK and where possible work within existing frameworks to ensure swift action is taken to assist these children.\r\n\r\nWe must put the best interests of children first, and avoid any policy that places children at additional risk or encourages them to place their lives in the hands of the people traffickers and criminal gangs.  In any response, we need to be very careful not to inadvertently create a situation in which families see an advantage in sending children ahead, putting their lives at risk by attempting perilous sea crossings to Europe.\r\n\r\nIn terms of support to Europe, we are providing significant assistance to Member States facing particular pressures to ensure that all refugees can have effective access to protection, wherever they are.
