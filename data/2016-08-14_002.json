However, concern was expressed by some that the use of planning conditions to require archaeological excavations would be curtailed by the Bill.   This interpretation does not accurately represent the Government’s intention.\r\n\r\nThe proposed power is to help address the urgent need to tackle the overuse of ‘pre-commencement’ conditions which prevent development, including new homes, from starting until the local planning authority has approved certain details.  The measure will not restrict the ability of local planning authorities to propose conditions that are necessary. In the unlikely event that an applicant refuses to accept a necessary pre-commencement condition proposed by a local planning authority, the authority can refuse planning permission. This will maintain appropriate protections for important matters such as heritage, as well as human health, the natural environment, green spaces, and measures to mitigate the risk of flooding. \r\n\r\nWe are not proposing that all pre-commencement conditions are removed; only that they are used proportionately and provide the applicant with an opportunity to agree to them before they are attached to planning permission.  The process envisaged by the Government is that the local planning authority will notify applicants of any proposed pre-commencement conditions before the determination of an application.  Most applicants are already aware of likely conditions through early engagement with the authority, at which point they can challenge any pre-commencement conditions which may be unnecessary or can be fulfilled at a later date (i.e. during build); ensuring construction can go ahead without delay.\r\n \r\nThe National Planning Policy Framework remains unchanged in that it requires “developers to record and advance understanding of the significance of any heritage assets to be lost (wholly or in part) in a manner proportionate to their importance and the impact, and to make this evidence (and any archive generated) publicly accessible.”\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the Government values the petition in highlighting the importance of archaeology and the historic environment as a material consideration in the planning process, and will continue to engage fully with the sector during the passage of the Bill and beyond. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Communities and Local Government","created_at":"2016-06-07T15:25:42.063Z","updated_at":"2016-06-07T15:25:42.063Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":124333,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/124333.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Save UK Air Cadet Gliding","background":"On March 10th 2016 it was announced that Gliding for UK Air Cadet Organization was being scaled back with heavy cuts to its locations and fleet.

A full inspection programme was initiated with a view to recovering all of the aircraft. However after substantial operational, technical and commercial negotiations with a range of leading aerospace companies, for most of the Vigilant aircraft and a few of the Vikings it no longer represented sensible value for money to continue their repair. \r\n\r\nIn order to give Cadets the opportunity to start flying again following an Air Cadet Organisation review there will be at least 73 Vikings, a fleet of up to 15 Vigilant aircraft, combined with an increase of an extra 25 Grob Tutor fixed wing Air Experience Flights (AEFs) – a more than 50% increase on previous flights. We are committed to returning as many gliders to the skies as possible while ensuring the safety of cadets and instructors. For the first time this will be backed by a range of realistic simulators provided by the RAF Charitable Trust.\r\n\r\nThe restructured glider fleet will be operated by fewer, but larger, Volunteer Gliding Squadrons (VGS), which will have a regional focus and be better integrated with synthetic training and increased AEF locations. The RAF is fully committed to Air Cadet flying. Where Cadets will have to travel longer distances, we are increasing investment in VGS and AEF sites to include residential accommodation for cadets and staff. In the future cadet flying will be better associated with force development and ground training opportunities alongside the gliding and flying.\r\n\r\nThe RAF acknowledges this has been a tough period for cadets and instructors and is grateful for the patience and understanding of the Volunteer Gliding Squadron instructors who continue to provide inspiration and leadership to generations of cadets. Air Cadet flying will be safer and far more resilient in the long run; enabling all cadets across the United Kingdom to have equal access to flying opportunities and which better integrates and allocates cadet flying opportunities between realistic synthetic flight simulation, glider flying and an increase of AEF flights.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence","created_at":"2016-03-21T17:18:30.239Z","updated_at":"2016-03-21T17:18:30.239Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":130730,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/130730.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make rape and sexual consent a mandatory part of sex education.","background":"Approximately 85,000 women and 12,000 men are raped in England and Wales alone every year; that's roughly 11 rapes every hour.\r\n\r\nIf rape and sexual consent were to become a part of sex education, children would learn from an early age the importance of consent and the consequences of rape. \r\n","additional_details":"","state":"open","signature_count":17687,"created_at":"2016-05-17T23:39:35.274Z","updated_at":"2016-08-13T22:39:28.635Z","open_at":"2016-05-18T12:41:12.328Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":"2016-07-12T14:01:13.916Z","scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2016-05-18T11:24:36.931Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2016-06-09T23:54:44.237Z","creator_name":"Eloise Boblin","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"The government is committed to challenging stereotypes around sexual violence to ensure that people properly understand the importance of consent.

SRE must be taught in all maintained secondary schools and we believe that most secondary academies and many primary schools also teach it. When any school provides SRE they have a statutory duty to have regard to the Secretary of State’s statutory Sex and Relationship Education Guidance (2000). You may find the guidance online at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sex-and-relationship-education \r\n\r\nThe statutory guidance makes clear that all sex and relationship education should be age-appropriate and that schools should ensure young people develop positive values and a moral framework that will guide their decisions, judgments and behaviour. \r\n\r\nPersonal, social, health and economic (PSHE) education can also provide an effective way of equipping pupils with the knowledge and skills to understand and manage difficult situations, recognise and manage risk, make safer choices, and recognise when pressure from others threatens their personal safety and wellbeing. It can also help them develop effective ways of resisting pressures, including knowing when, where and how to get help. We expect all schools to teach PSHE, and we are looking at ways of improving the status and provision of the subject across all schools. \r\n \r\nThe government commissioned the PSHE Association to produce guidance for teachers on teaching about consent which was published in March 2015.

But these decisions have to be made case by case in compliance with the public procurement rules, and must not be discriminatory, as a blanket ban (ie a boycott) would be.\r\n\r\nThe UK Government has a longstanding policy of value for money in public procurement.

Our reforms to the special educational needs and disabilities system emphasise providing tailored support to meet pupils’ specific needs. The reforms encourage close working with parents and pupils to make sure the support that pupils need is identified early. We work with, and provide funding to, dyslexia organisations to help to ensure that these pupils get the necessary support. \r\n\r\nIt is essential that all pupils leave primary school with the skills to succeed in secondary school. Pupils who can spell quickly and precisely are able to write down their ideas fluently and accurately, freeing them to concentrate on the meaning of what they want to say. Spelling is therefore a vital element of the National Curriculum at both key stages and is included as part of the teacher assessments of writing in Year 2 and Year 6. \r\n\r\nThe new interim teacher assessment framework for Key Stage 2 (KS2) is designed to assess the extent to which pupils have gained a secure grounding in the National Curriculum before they move on to the next stage of their education. This will be assessed by the pupils’ teachers. In writing, to meet the ‘expected standard’ pupils must be able to spell most words accurately, using the detailed spelling rules and guidance in the KS2 programme of study. The statutory KS2 wordlists are made up of words that we know pupils frequently misspell. \r\n\r\nThese assessments form part of the information used to help teachers and parents understand how pupils are performing against national expectations. They also allow us to hold schools to account for how well they have supported all their pupils to reach the expected standard.\r\n\r\nAssessment by pupils’ teachers at the end of Year 6 provides the secondary schools with accurate information on their new Year 7 pupils. The secondary schools can then effectively support all the pupils who did not meet the expected standard to achieve their full potential. They cannot respond quickly to these pupils’ needs if the assessment information they receive does not reflect accurately what pupils know and can do.\r\n\r\nOur approach applies to all pupils, including those with dyslexia, because it is in these pupils’ best interests that teachers assess accurately what they can or cannot do. \r\n\r\nStatutory assessments, however, form only part of the broader assessments that teachers continually make. Schools should report statutory assessment outcomes in the context of wider information about pupils’ overall achievements and progress across the whole curriculum.    \r\n\r\nDepartment for Education","created_at":"2016-05-04T13:58:31.211Z","updated_at":"2016-05-04T13:58:31.211Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":122024,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/122024.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make crohns and colitis disease a known  disability","background":"Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis are the two main forms of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, affecting more than 300,000 people in the UK.\r\n","additional_details":"Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis is largely a hidden disease, and one that causes stigma, fear and isolation – it’s thought that many people with the condition go undiagnosed and suffer in silence.

Anyone who has an impairment that fits the definition of a disability in section 6 of the 2010 Act is automatically protected from disability discrimination. Employers and service providers alike are required to ensure that disabled people are not treated less favourably compared to those that are not disabled. \r\n\r\nWhere a person has an impairment, of which Crohn’s Disease and Ulcerative Colitis could be one, then employers and service providers must make reasonable adjustments for them.  These reasonable adjustments are to ensure that disabled people are not treated less favourably than those that do not have the impairments.  In the case of service providers, they have the additional duty of having to anticipate the reasonable adjustments that their disabled service-users may require.  This could include providing a shelf or a table in disabled toilets, on which users can place their equipment and accessories. \r\n\r\nHowever, the 2010 Act also recognises the need to strike a balance between the needs of disabled people and the interests of those that provide services to members of the public.  What is ‘reasonable’ will vary from one situation to another.  This is because factors like the practicability of making the adjustment, the cost of the adjustment and the resources available to different organisation, will vary from one situation and service provider to another.      \r\nFor further advice, service-users can contact the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS), which provides free bespoke advice and in-depth support to individuals with any discrimination concerns.

Dickinson","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"Woodland cover in England is at its highest level since the 14th century. The National Planning Policy Framework provides strong protection for ancient woodlands.","details":"Our ancient woodlands are highly valued and cherished, and are a resource rich in life, providing homes and food for animals, birds and insects. They store carbon, produce oxygen and filter out pollution; they also provide some of the most interesting places for us to enjoy. We know that ancient woodlands are an irreplaceable habitat, which is why we recognise their special status in the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF), which was last updated in 2012.\r\n\r\nSince the Second World War, great efforts have been made to restore and actively manage our ancient woodlands. The ancient woodland inventory estimates approximately 340,000 hectares of woodland in England that is ancient. Subsequent estimates suggest that there are about 210,000 hectares of native woodland not on ancient woodland sites. Taken together, those two categories of woodland comprise just over half of England’s woodlands, at about 550,000 hectares.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have ambitions to increase woodland cover and improve the quality of our woodland management, we must be mindful that those ambitions sit alongside a need to increase food production, create renewable energy and capture carbon, while also maintaining the habitats that our wildlife depends on, such as our ancient woodlands. In order to compete globally economically, we need to update and upgrade our ageing infrastructure and ensure that development enables our economic growth to be sustained.\r\n\r\nWe have, however, always made a special case for our ancient woodland, which is why they are protected in the NPPF. The passage that deals with them clearly states:\r\n\r\n“Planning permission should be refused for development resulting in the loss or deterioration of irreplaceable habitats, including ancient woodland and … veteran trees … unless the need for, and benefits of, the development in that location clearly outweigh the loss”.\r\n\r\nThe position is very clear: there is protection. The Government certainly has no plans to undermine or change that position; figures from the Woodland Trust itself suggest that less than 0.25% of ancient woodland has been developed in the last 15 years, which indicates that this protection is working. Nevertheless, Natural England has been working with the Forestry Commission to produce refreshed guidance for all planning authorities to help them take full and proper account of ancient woodland in the planning process. This outlines a range of mitigation and compensation measures that may be offered by developers to offset loss or damage, where developments affecting ancient woodland and veteran trees may receive planning permission. \r\n\r\nIn addition to this, England’s woodland coverage is as high as it has been since the 14th century, totaling a little more than 1.3 million hectares, which equates to 41% of the UK total or 10% of England’s land area. We have a commitment to plant a further 11 million trees before the end of this Parliament. \r\n\r\nWe recognise that this issue is complex and we are continually striving to improve the operation of planning protections for ancient woodlands. The challenges we face today are totally different from the challenges of even 20 years ago, which is why we need to balance woodland interests with our wider competing land use requirements. The Government considers that the existing protection for ancient woodland in the NPPF is strong and is protecting our ancient woodlands and veteran trees. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food \u0026 Rural Affairs ","created_at":"2016-06-17T10:05:57.439Z","updated_at":"2016-06-17T10:07:25.853Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":123061,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/123061.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make passing / approaching horses and horse drawn vehicles part of  driving test","background":"Many deaths on the roads of horses and riders.

The guidance was produced by a multi-disciplinary group, including professionals, patients and the voluntary sector.  It was reviewed by a number of GPs, and was endorsed by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, the Royal College of General Practitioners, and the Royal College of Physicians.  This guidance can be found on the GOV.UK website, https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/cervical-screening-professional-guidance\r\n\r\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for Suspected cancer: recognition and referral (June 2015) are also available to help GPs assess when it is appropriate to refer patients for suspected cancer, including cervical cancer. It should be noted that a cervical screening test (previously known as a smear test) is a method of detecting abnormal cells on the cervix and is unlikely to be appropriate when a woman has gynaecological issues that are symptomatic of cancer. The guidelines recommend that GPs should consider a suspected cancer pathway referral (for an appointment within 2 weeks) for women if, on examination, the appearance of their cervix is consistent with cervical cancer and do not include the need to conduct a cervical screening test.  The guidelines are available on NICE’s website at www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng12\r\n\r\nFollowing advice from an expert advisory body, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, a routine HPV vaccination programme for girls has been available since 2008.  The aim of the programme is primarily to prevent cervical cancer, by routinely offering vaccination to girls aged around 13 years before they become sexually active.  It is expected that the HPV vaccination programme will reduce the already low rates of cervical cancer in these young women and allow them to be protected for years to come.\r\n\r\nWomen are invited for cervical screening from 25 years of age in order to identify and treat abnormalities in the cells of the cervix and the early signs of cancer.

The latter provides for public service pensions to be uprated at the same time and by the same percentage as the increase in the additional pension provided under the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (SERPS), which has been based on the increase in the CPI since April 2011. Prior to this date the RPI was used rather than the CPI. The underlying purpose of this legislation is to maintain the purchasing power of the additional elements of state retirement pensions and public service pensions. \r\n\r\nThe rationale for the change is as follows:\r\n•\tCPI is the headline measure of inflation used by the Bank of England;\r\n•\tCPI takes better account of how behaviour changes in response to price changes; \r\n•\tCPI also more accurately represents the inflation experience of pensioners and benefit recipients – for example, RPI excludes pensioners who receive a significant proportion of their income from the State (up to 20% of retired households); and\r\n•\tCPI is less volatile – for example, RPI was negative in September 2009 whereas CPI continued to rise.\r\n\r\nThe pension is accrued (or activated) on the basis of current prices.  The uprating of pensions does not apply retrospectively.\r\n\r\nIn response to a legal challenge against this decision the High Court and the Court of Appeal both ruled in the Government's favour, finding that CPI is appropriate for benefits and pensions uprating.\r\n\r\nRPI has also historically experienced periods of negative year on year change, as in 2009 when the uprating of pensions in payment was also frozen.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence","created_at":"2016-05-27T14:26:17.605Z","updated_at":"2016-05-27T14:28:05.184Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":131556,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/131556.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Fund more research into DIPG brain tumours, which are almost universally fatal.","background":"In April this year our world turned upside down and our heart shattered to pieces as the consultant's diagnosis confirmed that our beautiful 6 year old daughter Kaleigh had a condition called DIPG, a rare, aggressive, inoperable brain tumour.

In any response, we need to be very careful not to inadvertently create a situation in which families see an advantage in sending children ahead, putting their lives at risk by attempting perilous sea crossings to Europe.\r\n\r\nWe will work closely with local authorities. We must ensure we fulfil our obligations to children who are already in UK, as well ensuring we have the right support for those who may be brought to the UK from Europe.\r\n\r\nWe will consult relevant NGOs, UNHCR, UNICEF and Member States on how best we implement this legislation.  The very nature of this amendment means we must take the time to consult others before bringing final proposals on how to implement.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, the UK continues to take a comprehensive approach to the Syria conflict and migration crisis by providing significant aid and assistance; including our resettlement programmes.  On 4 February 2016, the Prime Minister announced that the UK will more than double our total pledge to the Syria crisis from £1.12 billion to over £2.3 billion.  This is our largest ever response to a single humanitarian crisis.  The Syrian Resettlement Scheme has already provided safe haven to more than 1000 vulnerable Syrians – around half of them children - and overall we expect children to make up a significant proportion of the 20,000 resettlement places we are providing to this group.\r\n\r\nAs announced on 21 April, we have worked closely with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to design a resettlement scheme that will protect the most vulnerable children. The new scheme has been designed with the UNHCR to resettle ‘children at risk’ from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.  The Government has committed to resettling several hundred individuals in the first year with a view to resettling up to 3000 individuals over the lifetime of this Parliament, the majority of which will be children, where the UNHCR deem it to be in their best interests. Children who are identified as at risk will be resettled with their family members or carers where appropriate.  There will be a review of the scheme at the two year mark.\r\n\r\nThis unique initiative will be the largest resettlement effort that focuses on children at risk from the MENA region.  The new scheme will be in addition to the Prime Minister’s commitment to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees. It is also in addition to our other existing resettlement schemes. \r\n\r\nIn regards to Europe, we are providing significant assistance to Member States facing particular pressures to ensure that all refugees can have effective access to protection, wherever they are.   The UK is the largest bilateral contributor to the humanitarian response to the crisis in Europe and the Balkans with a total contribution of £65m.

The purpose of the Success Regime is to improve and promote health and care services for patients in local health and care systems that are struggling with financial or quality problems, or sometimes both.  Two other health economies are also participating: Mid and South Essex and West, North and East Cumbria.\r\n\r\nThe regime is tailored to local circumstances, building on existing interventions and working with providers, commissioners and other local stakeholders to diagnose underlying issues and develop and implement the solutions to address both short-term performance and long-term strategic issues.\r\n\r\nFollowing an intense diagnostic phase, the North, East and West Devon Success Regime have published a “Case for Change” report, which sets out the underlying challenges facing the area and opportunities to reduce health inequalities, improve access to services and ensure clinical and financial stability. The Success Regime is now starting work locally to respond to the Case for Change. Potential service models for acute and community care are being considered. \r\n\r\nLocal and national leaders working as part of the Success Regime are conscious of the need to ensure that the people of North Devon are able to access high quality, sustainable services.

The IPSPC recommended that the Normal Pension Age (NPA) for the new schemes be increased in line with the State Pension Age (SPA) to reflect increased life expectancy, which has grown dramatically in the last few decades. It was also recommended that the link between SPA and NPA should be reviewed regularly with a preference for keeping the two pension ages linked. This would more fairly distribute the benefits between scheme members. An exception was made for the uniformed services where the new NPA was set to age 60, rather than the national age of 65, to reflect the unique characteristics of the work involved. \r\n\r\nFor members of Armed Forces Pension Scheme 2015 (AFPS15) personnel who do not serve until the NPA of 60, an Early Departure Payment (EDP) consisting of a tax-free lump sum and an annual income is provided to personnel; provided they have completed 20 years’ service and reached age 40.  A similar arrangement exists for AFPS 05 members in that they must be aged at least 40 and serve for 18 years. These payments are designed to compensate personnel for the fact that a full military career is not available to the majority of Regular Service personnel, and the corresponding reduction in pension. It should be taken into account that, even prior to the change in NPA, only 2% of Service personnel served through to age 55. For AFPS75 members they are eligible to receive an immediate pension, subject to meeting the pension scheme’s criteria but are not eligible to receive EDP payments. \r\n\r\nService personnel who transferred across to the new Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS 15) had the value of the pension benefits earned up to the introduction of the new scheme protected. These benefits remain payable at the time they were expected to be paid in accordance with the legacy pension scheme rules and linked to the final pensionable salary at the point of leaving the Services. For those who transferred to the new pension scheme, the qualification period for the new EDP also includes time spent in a legacy scheme.  For those members who were within 10 years of their normal pension age as at 1 Apr 2012 they will remain in their existing schemes and be bound by those terms and conditions.   \r\n\r\nIt should also be noted that pensions can be taken from age 55 under AFPS 15, but these are actuarially reduced to reflect the fact that the pension will be paid over a longer period.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence","created_at":"2016-05-25T10:36:54.733Z","updated_at":"2016-05-25T10:36:54.733Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":127045,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/127045.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Stop Clause 81 of the police and crime bill being passed as law.","background":"The supporters of this petition are against clause 81 of the police and crime bill.

It is supported by the British Medical Association, which will ballot junior doctors in June.","details":"Parliament has been updated regularly on all developments relating to the junior doctors’ contract, including through a number of statements, debates and questions. \r\n\r\nOn 19 May, Parliament was informed that, after 10 days of intensive discussion under the auspices of ACAS, an historic agreement has been reached between the government, NHS Employers (acting on behalf of the employers of junior doctors) and the British Medical Association (BMA).  This agreement will facilitate the biggest changes to the junior doctors’ contract since 1999 and will modernise the contract making it better for both doctors and patients. \r\n\r\nThe government has always been determined that the NHS should offer the safest, highest quality of care possible,  which means a consistent standard of care for patients admitted across all seven days of the week. Changes under the new contract include:\r\n\r\n•\testablishing the principle that any doctor who works less than an average of one weekend day a month (Saturday or Sunday) should receive no additional premium pay, compensated by an increase in basic pay of between 10 and 11%;\r\n•\treducing the marginal cost of employing additional doctors at the weekend by about a third;\r\n•\tsupporting all hospitals to meet the four clinical standards most important for reducing mortality rates for weekend admissions by establishing a new role for experienced junior doctors as ‘senior-clinical decision makers’ able to make expert assessments of vulnerable patients who may be admitted or staying in hospitals over weekends; and \r\n•\tremoving the disincentive to roster sufficient numbers of doctors at weekends by replacing an inflexible banding system with a fairer system that values weekend work by paying actual unsocial hours worked with more pay to those who work the most.\r\n\r\nThe government also recognises that safer care for patients is more likely to be provided by well-motivated doctors who have sufficient rest between shifts and work in a family-friendly system. The new contract and ACAS agreement will improve the wellbeing of the junior doctor workforce by:\r\n\r\n•\treducing the maximum hours a doctor can be asked to work in any one week from 91 to 72;\r\n•\treducing the number of nights a doctor can be asked to work consecutively to four and reducing the number of long days a doctor can be asked to work to five;\r\n•\tintroducing a new post, a Guardian of Safe Working, in every Trust to guard against doctors being asked to work excessive hours;\r\n•\tintroducing a new catch up programme for doctors who take maternity leave or time off for other caring responsibilities; \r\n•\testablishing a review by  Health Education England to consider how best to allow couples to apply to train in the same area and to offer training placements for those with caring responsibilities close to their home;\r\n•\tgiving pay protection to doctors who switch specialties because of caring responsibilities; and\r\n•\testablishing a review to inform a new requirement on Trusts to consider caring and other family responsibilities when designing rotas. \r\n\r\nTaken together these changes show both the government’s commitment to safe care for patients and the value it attaches to the role of junior doctors. This agreement will allow the government to deliver a seven day NHS, improve patient safety, and support much-needed productivity improvements, as well as strengthening the morale and quality of life of junior doctors with a modern contract fit for a modern health service.\r\n\r\nNHS Employers will publish a revised contract at the end of May and the Department of Health will publish an equalities analysis of the new terms. \r\n\r\nThe new contract and the agreement has the support of the Chair of the Junior Doctors’ Committee of the BMA, and will be put to a ballot of the BMA membership in June.  \r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2016-05-26T09:14:40.149Z","updated_at":"2016-05-26T09:14:40.149Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":131222,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/131222.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make British Sign Language part of the curriculum","background":"It's compulsory for students in England to take a language to 14 but signing isn't listed along with French, Germany or Mandarin.

This tragic incident further highlights the dangers of making perilous journeys across the Channel.\r\n\r\nThe Government continues to work with key EU Member States, including France, to ensure the Dublin Regulation family reunification process works effectively. Under the UK-France Joint Declaration, the UK and France have committed to ensuring that the provisions of the Dublin III Regulation are used efficiently and effectively.  To assist the handling of such cases, the two Governments have established a permanent official contact group, agreed single points of contact within respective Dublin Units and a UK asylum expert was seconded to the French administration to facilitate the improvement of all stages of the process.  The UK and France are running regular joint communication campaigns in northern France which inform unaccompanied children and others of their right to claim asylum in France. \r\n\r\nBetween the start of January 2016 and 2 July 2016, our records indicate that the UK has accepted over 50 requests from France under the Dublin Regulation to take charge of asylum seeking children on family grounds of which more than 40 have already been transferred to the UK.

Over 20 children who meet the criteria in the Immigration Act have been accepted for transfer to the UK since Royal Assent in May, the majority of whom have already arrived in the UK. As is required by the Immigration Act 2016, we are consulting with local authorities to confirm available capacity and to ensure appropriate support systems are in place. We are in active discussions with the UNHCR, UNICEF, NGOs and the Italian, Greek and French governments to strengthen and speed up mechanisms to identify, assess and transfer children who meet the criteria to the UK where this in their best interests.\r\n\r\nWe have always been clear that we want to support family reunification as much as possible. It is important to use the tools available to help children reunite with family wherever possible. We will prioritise cases with family links to the UK and where possible work within existing frameworks to ensure swift action is taken to assist these children.\r\n\r\nWe must put the best interests of children first, and avoid any policy that places children at additional risk or encourages them to place their lives in the hands of the people traffickers and criminal gangs.  In any response, we need to be very careful not to inadvertently create a situation in which families see an advantage in sending children ahead, putting their lives at risk by attempting perilous sea crossings to Europe.\r\n\r\nIn terms of support to Europe, we are providing significant assistance to Member States facing particular pressures to ensure that all refugees can have effective access to protection, wherever they are.
