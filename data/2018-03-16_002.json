The Government has no plans to introduce licensing.","details":"The Government has no plans to license grouse moors nor to introduce vicarious liability in England for offences related to wildlife crime. The introduction of such new regulation would require evidence that it will be effective. We are not aware of compelling evidence that the introduction of such provisions would have a significant deterrent effect on those who persecute wildlife. We will continue to monitor the situation in Scotland and to consider whether this approach is necessary and proportionate to assist in tackling wildlife crime in England.\r\n\r\nThe Government appreciates that many people have strongly held views on grouse shooting. The Government also recognises that shooting activities bring many benefits to the rural economy and the environment, in particular wildlife and habitat conservation. The Government therefore continues to support shooting, recognising it is vital that wildlife and habitats are respected and protected and we ensure a sustainable, mutually beneficial relationship between shooting and conservation. \r\n\r\nThe Government recognises the international importance of the UK uplands. The UK has 75 percent of the world’s remaining heather moorland and about 13 percent of the world’s blanket bog (rain-fed peat bog that ‘blankets’ the landscape). Seventy percent of the UK’s drinking water is provided from upland catchments and tourism brings in an estimated £1.78 billion to England’s upland national parks.\r\n\r\nNatural England is working with landowners of grouse moors within special areas of conservation to develop long term land management plans, which include vegetation management principles for the various habitats on grouse moors. The Government encourages land managers to work closely with Natural England to put these plans in place for all the benefits they bring to moor owners and to the environment.\r\n\r\nWith regard to grouse moorland management, grouse shooting is one of the main land uses in the uplands along with grazing and forestry. The Government recognises that healthy, active peat provides good habitat for grouse as well as numerous environmental benefits and ecosystem services. The Government is working with moor owners and stakeholders to further improve management practices and peat condition, such as through the Blanket Bog Restoration Strategy.\r\n\r\nWith regard to birds of prey, like all wild birds they are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The current legislation and guidance balances competing social, economic and environmental interests, while protecting the conservation status and welfare of the relevant bird of prey species. Some species of birds of prey need specific protection because their low numbers indicate that their populations are struggling.\r\n\r\nThe Government takes the decline in the hen harrier population in England very seriously and is committed to securing its future. In January 2016 we published the Hen Harrier Action Plan to increase the English hen harrier population. It contains six actions that individually can bring benefits for hen harriers, but when combined underpin each other and have the potential to deliver positive outcomes. \r\n\r\nThe Action Plan was developed with senior representatives from organisations including Natural England, the Moorland Association, the National Gamekeepers’ Organisation, the Game \u0026 Wildlife Conservation Trust, National Parks England and formerly the RSPB. These organisations, led by Natural England, will monitor activities and report annually on progress to the Defra Uplands Stakeholder Forum and the UK Tasking and Co-ordinating group for Wildlife Crime.\r\n\r\nRaptors, like all wild birds, are afforded protection from illegal killing by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. However, the Government is concerned that there are still individuals who continue to commit these crimes. \r\n\r\nAs a result, the Government has identified the illegal persecution of raptors as a wildlife crime priority. Each wildlife crime priority has a delivery group to consider what action should be taken, and develop a plan to prevent crime, gather intelligence on offences and enforce against it. The Raptor Persecution Priority Delivery Group is made up of representatives from Government and non-government organisations working together to help preserve and protect the six UK priority raptor species (goshawk, red kite, golden eagle, hen harrier, peregrine falcon and white tailed eagle). \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the National Wildlife Crime Unit, which is part-funded by Defra, provides valuable intelligence and operational support to police forces in tackling wildlife crimes, including raptor persecution. There are strong penalties in place to punish those committing offences against birds of prey and other wildlife. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","created_at":"2018-03-08T16:49:57.844Z","updated_at":"2018-03-08T16:49:57.844Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":200952,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/200952.json"},"attributes":{"action":"House of Commons vote on whether Brexit should be cancelled.","background":"Brexit was initiated on the basis that it was the 'will of the people' and the Government needed to act on that.

The Government does not intervene in the way that road closures are managed for Remembrance Sunday Parades. ","details":"The Government fully recognises the enormous sacrifices that have been made by British military personnel. Remembrance ceremonies and parades are an important and valued means by which communities across the country honour the sacrifice of British service personnel.\r\n\r\nWe are very sensitive to the pressures the police face. We recognised the importance of wider policing in the 2015 Spending Review, which protected overall police spending in real terms. Also nationally, the police hold over £1.6 billion of financial reserves.\r\n\r\nForces are expected to hold reasonable contingencies in their budgets to cover the costs of policing events, particularly annual ceremonial events such as Remembrance Sunday parades. Additional funding is normally only considered in respect of special events where their policing costs exceed one per cent of a police force’s total funding, or where meeting these costs would place a force at financial risk.\r\n\r\nThere is no Government policy on road closures for Remembrance Sunday Parades and there is no proposal to introduce legislation. It is for the local traffic authority (that is, the council of the relevant county or metropolitan district, not the police) to decide on the road closure or other legally enforceable traffic management measures it considers necessary for the conduct of any local on-road event. These are decisions for which it is responsible to its electorate. \r\n\r\nRoad closures for local Remembrance Sunday Parades are effected through Traffic Regulation Orders made under section 16A of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. Section 16A is used to close roads temporarily for \"sporting events, social events or entertainment\", collectively known as special events. Under section 16A, a local traffic authority can impose temporary highway restrictions for a special event once and for up to three days in any calendar year. \r\n\r\nRestrictions for special events over and above this that affect the same length of road require the consent of the Secretary of State for Transport. Otherwise, the Department for Transport does not get involved and the event remains purely a local matter. Where the Secretary of State’s consent is required, the Department does not impose conditions on the way that the road is to be closed and does not charge the local authority for granting consent. \r\n\r\nAs with any event, decisions on the deployment of resources to police road closures are operational matters for the Chief Constable of the force concerned, in association with Police and Crime Commissioners. The Police have not and do not routinely police Remembrance Parades and are more likely to determine the level of policing required for an event on the basis of an assessment of crime, disorder and public safety. \r\n\r\nThe police’s role is to enforce the general law on road traffic and any special measures introduced for the event in question, such as a local Traffic Regulation Order. They also have a general power to direct traffic. The authority or police may advise the local community on other steps that might be taken and associated measures that might be desirable, such as the taking out of insurance. How the police carry out enforcement is a matter for their discretion.\r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2017-11-08T09:57:36.327Z","updated_at":"2018-01-09T17:19:09.506Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":201563,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/201563.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Introduce a 5p charge on single-use plastic straws.","background":"Over 550 million plastic straws are used every day in the US \u0026 UK.

Tragic cases such as Brandon’s death highlight the need to do all we can to prevent it and tackle every instance where it arises. \r\n \r\nThat is why we have sent a clear message to schools that bullying, for whatever reason, is unacceptable and should not be tolerated.  \r\n \r\nMost bullying can be dealt with within schools’ existing disciplinary frameworks. We are making Relationships Education in primary schools, and Relationship and Sex Education (RSE) in secondary schools mandatory, and we expect the associated guidance to cover issues such as respect, friendships, cyber-bullying and staying safe online. We have recently launched a call for evidence to gather the views of teachers, parents, and young people to help us shape relationships education and RSE. \r\n \r\nLaws are already in place to protect people when any form of bullying behaviour constitutes a criminal offence. This includes some types of harassing or threatening behaviour, or communications which can be a criminal offence, for example under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, the Malicious Communications Act 1988, the Communications Act 2003, and the Public Order Act 1986.  \r\n \r\nIf school staff, or parents, feel that a criminal offence may have been committed they should seek assistance from the police.

It has taken steps to manage tyres on public service vehicles and initiated research. Extra measures are not ruled out.","details":"The Government takes road safety very seriously and has taken action to control the use of older tyres on public service vehicles (PSV) in response to the tragic event on the A3 in September 2012. The Government is committed to using robust evidence to guide policy decisions and further measures are not ruled out.\r\n\r\nConsultations with experts from the UK and EU tyre industry revealed that tyre ageing is more complex than a simple relationship with chronological age and is related to wider issues such as tyre use and maintenance. \r\n\r\nIn seeking scientific evidence to inform the policy options, it became clear that there is limited research in this field. Therefore, in January 2018, the Department for Transport initiated a 12-month programme of independent research with the purpose of gaining a better understanding of the ageing process of tyres. This research seeks to quantify the effect of age on a tyre’s integrity, provide guidance on whether an age limit is appropriate and, if so, what that limit should be. The findings of the research will inform decisions and will be published. \r\n\r\nIn advance of the research, the Government worked with the tyre industry, the Traffic Commissioners and the vehicle operating industry to improve tyre management.  In 2014, guidance was issued to all PSV operators and to the members of the trade associations - the Confederation of Passenger Transport and the Road Haulage Association. This guidance explained how to establish the age of a tyre and included a recommendation that any tyre over 10 years of age should only be fitted as part of a twin wheel arrangement on a rear axle. This initial guidance was supplemented by a more comprehensive tyre maintenance guide, produced by the tyre industry with the support of the Senior Traffic Commissioner and the Department for Transport (the Department), aimed at ensuring good tyre maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe Department ensured that a printed copy of this guide was delivered to every PSV operator. This guidance is also available on the British Tyre Manufacturers’ Association website (http://btmauk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/October-2016-CV-TyreManagement-LINKS-270916.pdf).\r\n\r\nIn parallel, Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) enforcement staff carried out spot checks on older buses and coaches to assess the age of tyres in this segment of the national fleet. These checks were in addition to their normal enforcement programme. A year after the initial guidance was published, a further survey of older buses and coaches indicated a reduction in the average age of tyres fitted in the PSV fleet and demonstrated widespread compliance with the published advice. \r\n\r\nThe combination of guidance and enforcement has been successful to date. Official figures show that in the period between June and September 2017, the DVSA conducted 28,524 roadworthiness inspections on PSVs. Of those, approximately 0.23% failed to meet the minimum requirements for tyres set down in regulation.  Approximately 0.03% of the vehicles had tyres older than 10 years fitted to the front axle and, importantly, only four of these vehicles (approximately 0.014%) had tyres older than 11 years. These figures indicate that the industry is adhering to the guidance that has been issued. DVSA vehicle examiners have been instructed to remain vigilant and to issue official advice notes to reinforce the message on those operators who have not followed best practice.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Department wants to go further in examining this important issue. It will continue to monitor the use of tyres in the PSV fleet and will look carefully at the evidence that emerges from the independent scientific research to determine what further measures are appropriate.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport","created_at":"2018-03-01T14:39:43.963Z","updated_at":"2018-03-01T14:39:43.963Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":214119,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/214119.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make Universities UK subject to the Freedom of Information Act.","background":"We ask that the appropriate Government Minister make an order under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 Section 5(1) designating Universities UK as a public authority, so making Universities UK subject to the Freedom of Information Act.","additional_details":"Universities are rightly subject to the Freedom of Information Act.

The support we need to provide extends far beyond financial support however. The Department of Health plans to publish a Carers Action Plan this spring setting out plans around support for carers.\r\n\r\nFormal carers, i.e. those who are employed as “professional” carers, do of course need to receive all the protections that employment law offers, including receiving at least the National Living Wage/National Minimum Wage from their employers. \r\n\r\nInformal carers are those who provide care for family or friends and they do receive help through the benefit system, primarily through Carer’s Allowance (CA) (which was introduced in 1976) and for those on lower incomes, through means-tested benefits. For people who give up the opportunity of full-time employment in order to provide regular and substantial care for a severely disabled person, CA aims to provide a measure of financial support and recognition, but it is not designed to be a carer’s wage or to replace all lost earnings. \r\n\r\nA carer may apply for CA if they provide care for 35 hours or more a week to a person on one of the qualifying disability benefits. They must be aged 16 years or over and not be in full time education (21 hours or more a week). For those carers who can undertake some part-time work, there is an earnings limit in Carer’s Allowance. CA can be received alongside part-time earnings of up to £116 net of certain expenses a week (rising to £120 net a week from April 2018). Allowable expenses include income tax, National Insurance contributions and half of any contributions to an occupational or personal pension. Also, up to half the net earnings figure calculated can be allowed towards the cost of alternative care for the disabled person, or for a child aged under 16, while the carer is at work. These rules mean that people can earn significantly more than the earnings limit and still get CA. Where possible, informal carers are encouraged to continue either working or studying part-time alongside their caring responsibilities in order to improve their own life chances and increase their social interaction. \r\n\r\nCA is funded from general taxation and does not depend on an individual's National Insurance contributions. CA is up-rated in line with the Consumer Price Index and since 2010 the rate has increased from £53.90 to £62.70 (rising again to £64.60 a week in April). That means that from April 2018, carers will be £550 a year better off than they were in 2010. By 2022/23 we will be spending nearly £4 billion a year on CA. This is a clear indication of the Government’s commitment to carers.\r\n\r\nCarers who are on low incomes can also claim income-related benefits, such as Income Support and Pension Credit. These benefits can be paid to carers at a higher rate than those without caring responsibilities through the carer premium or the equivalent additional amount for carers respectively, both currently worth up to £34.95 a week (increasing to £36.00 a week in April). Receipt of means tested benefits can act as a “passport” to help with prescriptions and dental charges. \r\n\r\nPeople who are not eligible for Carer’s Allowance but who are looking after sick or elderly family or friends may be eligible for Carers Credit which helps them build qualifying years for State Pension. To qualify for carer’s credit a person must be caring for one, (or more), person for at least 20 hours a week, be over 16 years old but under State Pension age. The person being cared for must get one of the following: \r\n•       A qualifying benefit, or \r\n•       Be certified by a health or social care professional as needing the amount of care being provided \r\n\r\nThe Government’s Fuller Working Lives Strategy sets out what the Government is doing to support those carers who wish to remain in and return to work; as well as highlighting the sort of support that good employers should give to carers in their workforce, such as flexible working. To spearhead some of this work the Government appointed the Business in the Community (BiTC) Age at Work leadership team as Business Champion for Older Workers. The Leadership Team spearhead the Government’s work to support employers to retain, retrain and recruit older workers. They actively promote the benefits of both employing and retaining older workers to employers across England – influencing them both strategically and in terms of practical advice. This work also benefits carers in the workplace. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions","created_at":"2018-02-28T17:06:48.916Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T17:06:48.916Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":209458,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/209458.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Theresa May: Cancel the invitation for Saudi Crown Prince to visit the UK","background":"We call on the Prime Minister to withdraw the invitation for the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to visit the UK.

Visits in both directions are an important opportunity for us to have constructive discussions about the full range of issues that are of mutual concern. \r\n\r\nThe Crown Prince has embarked on a series of reforms to modernise society and the economy within Saudi Arabia. The country is changing rapidly, with steps such as allowing women to drive and attend football matches, reopening cinemas and a commitment that women will make up one third of the Saudi workforce by 2030. The Crown Prince has also set out his commitment to return Saudi Arabia to a moderate Islam that is open to all religions.\r\n\r\nThis greater inclusivity is vital for the future of Saudi Arabia and the UK will support Saudi Arabia as it embarks on this era of change. The Crown Prince’s agenda will bring new opportunities for us to work together for the long-term benefit, stability and success of both our countries. \r\nWe welcome the recent positive developments, but we also recognise that there are further steps to take. \r\nOur starting point for engagement on human rights with all countries is based on what is practical, realistic and achievable, and we will always be ready to speak out as a matter of principle. We raise our concerns with the Saudi Arabian authorities using a range of Ministerial and diplomatic channels of communication, including our Ambassador, the Embassy team and the European Union in Riyadh.

The UK will continue to play a leading role in supporting the UN to find a peaceful solution to the conflict, including through close engagement with our regional and international partners. Inward visits provide further opportunities for the UK to discuss solutions to the crisis. \r\n\r\nThe UK supports the Saudi-led Coalition military intervention, which came at the request of the internationally-recognised Yemeni President Hadi, to deter aggression by the Houthis, and allow for the return of the legitimate Yemeni Government.  The Houthis have consistently failed to adhere to UN Security Council Resolutions, including by launching attacks against Saudi Arabia and shipping in the Bab al-Mandab strait.\r\n\r\nWe regularly raise the importance of compliance with International Humanitarian Law (IHL) with the Saudi Arabian Government and other members of the military Coalition.

They are an important indicator of the great strides we have made in improving our waterways, with more than 5,300 miles of rivers being improved since 2010. There have been no reintroductions of otters by conservation groups since the late 1990s and the bulk of the recovery of the otter has been through natural re-colonisation.  \r\n\r\nA healthy otter population results from favourable conditions in the natural environment, including water quality and the availability of prey (including fish), as well as availability of breeding sites. Otters are found at low density, and limit their own populations through territorial activity. Carrying capacity is determined by environmental conditions.\r\n\r\nThere is no evidence to suggest that otters have a major impact on wildlife as a whole, and although localised impacts could occur where otters have not been previously present for some time, they are a natural part of the freshwater ecosystem and we believe these systems will adapt to the return of the natural top predator.  \r\n\r\nWe do recognise that otters can in some instances impact on still water fisheries, which is why there is provision through the Angling Improvement Fund (AIF), administered by the Angling Trust on the Environment Agency’s behalf, to help deliver improvements including projects to protect fisheries from otter predation through the erection of otter-proof fencing.

Aside from the Health and Care Professions Council, the fee required by the NMC is the cheapest of the nine. \r\n\r\nThe NMC’s fee has been held at £120 per annum since February 2015. This has been made possible due to operational efficiency savings made by the NMC, which have offset cost pressures, including inflation.   \r\n\r\nThe NMC has informed us that its Council undertakes an annual review of registration fees, to ensure it has sufficient funds to carry out its regulatory functions to the level required to protect the public.\r\n\r\nSince its establishment in 2002, the NMC has increased its annual fee on three occasions: in August 2007 from £43 to £76, in February 2013 from £76 to £100 and in February 2015 from £100 to £120. In each case the proposed increase was subject to public consultation and scrutiny. These increases were deemed essential to ensure the NMC was adequately funded to exercise its statutory duties in order to protect the public.\r\n\r\nSince June 2016, nurses and midwives have been able to spread the cost of their annual registration fee through quarterly direct debit instalments.

In areas identified as especially high risk, such as the hard shoulder on motorways, the Department for Transport placed a specific responsibility on Highways England, under the Infrastructure Act 2015, to have due regard to the need to protect and improve the safety of the strategic road network as a whole for all road users. This includes ensuring that roadside vehicle recovery operations are safe for both recovery drivers and all other road users. \r\n\r\nAs a first step towards this goal, the Government set a challenging target. Highways England has a target to reduce those killed or seriously injured on their strategic road network, of a decrease of at least 40% by the end of 2020 against the 2005-09 average baselines. Further details on Highways England’s Health \u0026 Safety 5 year plan is available on the Highways England website: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/highways-england-health-and-safety.\r\n\r\nRules 219 and 281 of the Highway Code provide for emergency and incident support vehicles and their corresponding warning signs or flashing lights. These rules advise drivers to be aware of emergency or incident support vehicles on the road: it provides advice on which warning lights or signals these vehicles use, and advises drivers to exercise extra care and attention including slowing down, being prepared to stop, and to follow any directions given by police officers, or traffic officers, as to whether drivers can safely pass an incident or blockage.\r\n\r\nWhether on the strategic road network or on local roads, the police already have powers to deal with road users who do not slow down or move over for vehicles that have broken down or been involved in accidents on the roadside. Road users, are required to comply with road traffic law in the interests of their own safety and that of other road users. If road users do not adopt a responsible attitude, or if their use of the highway creates an unsafe environment or causes a nuisance, they may be committing a number of offences. For example, under sections 2 and 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (as amended) a person may be charged with the offences of dangerous driving, or careless and inconsiderate driving. In each case it is for the police to enforce the law.\r\n\r\nThe Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 also requires employers to ensure the safety of their employees during the course of their work. HSE would expect that employers have arrangements in place to ensure that safe working procedures are used, vehicles and equipment of an appropriate standard are provided and maintained, where necessary, appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) is provided and used, and all persons have been adequately trained by a competent person on how to work safely at the roadside and the precautions they should be recommending to the occupants of incident support vehicles.

It is important that the police are able to quickly and easily identify a vehicle and people are able to remember registration numbers.  To this end, the law requires that number plates are clearly readable.\r\n\r\nThe rules regarding what can be displayed on a number plate, including any optional national flags, are specified in UK law.  These rules help to ensure safety on our roads.  They support the police and other enforcement agencies in identifying vehicles to prevent and detect crime particularly through the use of Automatic Number Plate Recognition cameras.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to displaying the registration number, the law provides for the voluntary use of the display of the European Union flag (the circle of stars) or specific national identifiers.  The display of the European flag with the inclusion of a GB identifier, called the Europlate, enables motorists to travel within the European Union without the need to display the conventional oval ‘GB’ sticker to identify the member state in which the vehicle is registered.  Currently, UK motorists travelling within the EU can display either the traditional oval GB sticker or the Europlate.  No decisions have yet been taken on the status of the Europlate after the UK leaves the EU. \r\n\r\nThe law was changed in 2009 to also allow the voluntary display of UK national flags.  This means that motorists are able to choose to display the Union Flag, the Cross of St George, Scottish Saltire or the Red Dragon of Wales on their number plate.   However, it is entirely a matter of personal choice whether to display a national flag on a number plate and no one is compelled to do so.

We recognise the importance for people with ADHD of receiving a timely diagnosis and appropriate support. Current legislation and guidelines set out how services should support people of all ages with ADHD. \r\n\r\nIn 2016, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) published a guideline on diagnosing and managing ADHD for people aged 3 and above. This aims to improve the diagnosis of ADHD as well as the quality of care and support for people with an ADHD diagnosis. An updated guideline is expected to be published in February 2018.\r\n\r\nThe Care Act 2014 represents the most comprehensive reform of social care legislation in over 60 years. The Act puts in place requirements for local authorities to meet a person’s eligible care and support needs, including those of people with ADHD, and to help and protect people with care and support needs, who may be at risk of abuse or neglect as a result of those needs. \r\n\r\nThe Government recognises that children and young people with ADHD often need special educational provision and under the Children and Families Act (2014), local authorities, health and care services must commission services jointly to ensure the needs of children and young people with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) are met. Local Authorities must publish a clear outline of services available which has been developed for, and with, parents and young people. \r\n\r\nWe have also introduced a more streamlined assessment process to develop Education, Health and Care plans to support children and young people with SEND. These are co-ordinated across education, health and care, and involve children and young people and their families throughout the process.\r\n\r\nThese measures aim to reduce health inequalities and improve outcomes for children and young people with SEND and their families.  \r\n\r\nWe recognise that having ADHD can lead people to experience mental health problems and the Government is committed to improving mental health support and services. We have increased funding for mental health services by 8.4% since 2014/15 and last year, spend was the highest ever at £11.6bn.  \r\n\r\nWe have also commissioned NICE and the National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health (NCCMH) to improve mental health service pathways and tackle variations in provision.

","details":"The Government recognises the valuable service that good letting agents provide to both landlords and tenants in ensuring that properties are safe, compliant and professionally managed. We are keen to see all tenants receiving a good and affordable service. A ban on letting fees paid by tenants will improve transparency and affordability for renters - letting fees are currently not clearly or consistently explained with the result that many tenants are unaware of the true costs of renting a property.\r\n\r\nThe Government published the draft Tenant Fees Bill on 1 November (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/draft-tenants-fees-bill), which sets out the detailed approach to banning letting fees to tenants in England, helping millions of renters by bringing an end to costly upfront payments and renewal fees.\r\n\r\nThe draft Tenant Fees Bill reflects feedback from the eight week public consultation (April – June 2017), which received over 4,700 responses. More than 9 out of 10 tenants who responded to the consultation backed the action to ban letting fees. We are ensuring that tenants will only be required to pay rent alongside a refundable deposit.\r\n\r\nMany letting agents and landlords acknowledge that fees charged to tenants are currently not at a level that is justifiable and agree that intervention is necessary. The Government does not believe that a cap would be effective and is likely to lead to a race to the top in terms of fees charged. A ban is easier to understand and enforce.\r\n\r\nWe believe that tenants will see a net saving as a result of the ban.  Tenants will be able to see what a given property will cost them in the advertised rent level without any additional hidden costs. This will help to make entering and moving around in the private rented sector easier and less costly.\r\n\r\nWe recognise that agents will need to consider their business models. The time of, and services provided by, letting agents should be reimbursed but this should be by landlords rather than tenants. Landlords are better able to shop around for the agent offering the service that they are seeking at the price they want to pay. It is also worth noting that landlords, unlike tenants, can claim tax relief on letting agent fees.\r\n\r\nGood letting agents, providing services that represent value for money to landlords, will continue to play an important role in the market. Furthermore, such letting agents will be on a fairer footing to compete for landlords’ business since it will be much harder for rogue agents to exploit their position between landlords and tenants. \r\n \r\nPublishing a bill in draft enables scrutiny of our proposals to ban letting fees by Parliament and stakeholders ahead of introducing legislation. The Communities and Local Government Select Committee is currently holding a public inquiry into the draft Bill. We welcome Parliamentary scrutiny on whether the draft Bill achieves its aim of delivering a fairer, more competitive, and more affordable lettings market where tenants have greater clarity and control over what they will pay and where the landlord is the primary customer of the letting agent. The Government will then seek to introduce the Bill formally to Parliament at the earliest opportunity. We will do this as soon as parliamentary time allows. We do not expect implementation to be before April 2019. This will allow letting agents time to prepare and re-negotiate their contracts.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Housing, Communities and Local Government","created_at":"2018-02-20T12:01:09.205Z","updated_at":"2018-02-20T13:48:40.475Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":211656,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/211656.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Drop any proposals to licence airguns in England \u0026 Wales","background":"We are strongly opposed to this as the introduction of licencing or further restrictions as they apply to everyone will have a disproportionate effect on the law abiding, safe and responsible shooters, sportsmen and women.","additional_details":"","state":"open","signature_count":10620,"created_at":"2018-02-01T20:53:21.930Z","updated_at":"2018-03-15T23:26:15.469Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-02-07T18:29:04.948Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-02-01T21:26:42.209Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2018-02-26T15:42:00.015Z","government_response_at":"2018-03-14T10:36:30.592Z","debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"mark hurst","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"The Government is reviewing the regulation of air weapons in England and Wales.

It is also an offence for a person aged under 18 to possess an air weapon or ammunition unless: \r\n•\tthey are being supervised by a person aged 21 or over, or \r\n•\tthey are shooting as a member of an approved target shooting club, or \r\n•\tthey are using air weapons at a shooting gallery, or \r\n•\tthe young person is aged 14 or over, is on private premises and has the consent of the occupier.\r\n\r\nThe Crime and Security Act 2010 brought in legislation concerned with reducing the risk of children getting hold of air weapons and accidentally harming themselves or others. This inserted a provision into the Firearms Act 1968 that requires owners to take reasonable precautions to prevent a person under the age of 18 from gaining unauthorised access to an air weapon. \r\nThe Government has sought the views of interested parties on relevant issues, including secure storage and the arrangements to prevent children gaining access to air weapons, manufacturing standards, and on the position in Scotland and Northern Ireland where air weapons are licensed. The Government has received a large number of representations about the review and these will be considered carefully before any decisions are made about how to proceed.\r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2018-03-14T10:36:30.590Z","updated_at":"2018-03-14T10:36:30.590Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":201217,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/201217.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Bus passes for Over Sixties in England","background":"We as women aged 60 are not allowed a concession bus pass in England .
