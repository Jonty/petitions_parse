The Forestry Commission only permits trail hunting on its land under strictly controlled agreements.","details":"The Hunting Act 2004 came into effect on 18 February 2005 and bans all hunting of wild mammals with dogs in England and Wales, except where it is carried out in accordance with the exemptions set out in Schedule 1 to the Act. \r\n\r\nMany hunts have since turned to trail hunting as an alternative to live quarry hunting, which involves the hunting of an artificial scent, or the scent of a fox, deer or mink, to mimic live quarry racing. A huntsman will go out ahead of the field and lay a trail; the dogs and followers will then follow this trail. Because the huntsmen or followers do not know in advance the route hounds will take when following the trail, trail hunting tends to closely match traditional live quarry hunting.\r\n\r\nIt is for the Forestry Commission to decide whether to permit trail hunting on its land.\r\n  \r\nThe Forestry Commission only permits trail hunting on the Public Forest Estate (PFE) to members of the Masters of Fox Hounds Association (MFHA) and the Masters of Draghounds and Bloodhounds Association (MDBA). The Forestry Commission enters into master agreements with the MFHA and MDBA, which strictly govern the terms under which trail and drag hunting are permitted on the PFE.\r\n\r\nThe agreements oblige each hunt to obtain a separate permission from the Forest Management Director of the District to trail and drag hunt on the PFE and to agree dates and routes four weeks prior to the commencement of the season in November.\r\n\r\nThe permission obliges the hunt to maintain £5 million liability insurance and indemnify the Forestry Commission against any damage or loss. The permission also strictly enforces the byelaws of the Forestry Commission and gives the Forest Management Director the ability to restrict the number of hounds and manner of hunting.\r\n\r\nThe Head of Estates meets the MFHA annually to review the previous season’s activity and to report on any issues and agree any actions that need to be taken. Through the agreements with MFHA and MDBA, the Forestry Commission is able to monitor the conduct of trail hunts on the PFE to ensure hunts comply with legislation.\r\n\r\nThe Government has no plans to ban trail hunting, which is a legitimate activity. Anyone who believes an offence is taking place, or has taken place, during a hunt (including trail hunting) should report the matter to the Police, as they deal with complaints of illegal hunting. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","created_at":"2018-10-17T15:05:28.675Z","updated_at":"2018-10-17T15:05:28.675Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":230451,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/230451.json"},"attributes":{"action":"UK government to integrate all rights in UN CEDAW Convention into domestic law.","background":"In 1986 the UK government ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).

Indeed, a number of the Convention’s obligations do not confer rights on people (for example, Article 5) and accordingly, it is neither appropriate nor possible for legislation to address such obligations. We have put in place a combination of policies and legislation to give effect to the UN human rights treaties that the United Kingdom has ratified, including CEDAW. \r\n\r\nWomen and girls’ rights under CEDAW are largely reflected in existing domestic legislation, such as the Equality Act 2010 and the Human Rights Act 1998. As such, we do not agree that domestic legislation needs to incorporate all the provisions of CEDAW. Moreover, were we to do this within the scope of the Equality Act 2010, it would create a hierarchy of rights in terms of sex as compared to other protected characteristics where the equivalent of CEDAW does not exist.\r\n\r\nThe UK acceded to the Optional Protocol to CEDAW on 17 December 2004. The Protocol recognises the competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to receive and consider complaints from individuals or groups within its jurisdiction. It also creates an inquiry procedure enabling the Committee to initiate inquiries into situations of grave or systematic violations of women’s rights. \r\n\r\nIt is clear there is an incredibly broad range of work still to be done. Building on the introduction of our world leading regulations which requires every large employer to publish their gender pay and bonus gaps every year, we will continue to step up our efforts to eliminate the gender pay gap entirely, which is central to growing our economy. \r\n\r\nWe want to have 33 per cent of all board and senior leadership positions, such as board directors, in the FTSE 350 are held by women by 2020 so that young women see women in leadership positions in every part of society.\r\nTo ensure we protect and support victims, recognise the life-long impact domestic abuse can have on children and make sure agencies respond to domestic abuse, we will publish a landmark draft Domestic Abuse Bill later in this parliamentary session.\r\n\r\nWe will continue to work on building a society where gender has no bearing on a person’s pay or opportunity.\r\n\r\nGovernment Equalities Office\r\n","created_at":"2018-11-20T11:28:42.994Z","updated_at":"2018-11-20T11:28:42.994Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":229894,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/229894.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Save Our Parks","background":"Thousands of Britain’s parks and play areas are falling into disrepair or are under threat of being sold to developers.\r\nThis is despite the vital health and social benefits that our much-loved green spaces provide.\r\nWe support The Mail on Sunday’s campaign to Save Our Parks from being lost forever.","additional_details":"We want:\r\n\r\n1)\tA statutory requirement for councils to ring-fence funding for parks at £30 per household per year. \r\n\r\n2)\tThere to be a legal duty for all green space to be managed to a good standard.\r\n\r\n3)\tNew rules banning the development on, or the inappropriate use of, parkland.\r\n\r\n4)\tA new central Government fund to provide emergency help for parks most at risk and ensure the long-term future of Britain's green spaces.","state":"open","signature_count":11999,"created_at":"2018-10-06T14:42:22.387Z","updated_at":"2018-11-24T23:56:03.401Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-10-12T13:55:41.990Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-10-06T14:51:36.395Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2018-11-13T13:52:39.192Z","government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Michael Powell","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":228702,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/228702.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Ban the EU flag from UK Armed Forces uniforms.","background":"It is a travesty to see uniforms of Her Majesty's Armed Forces corrupted with the flag of the EU, an anti-democratic wannabe superstate which we're thankfully leaving.\r\nMembers of the Armed Forces serve the Monarch and the democratic will of the British People and NOT Mr Juncker or EU technocrats.","additional_details":"UK forces under the EU flag Sept 2018:\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZMhx0T9Tfg\r\nThis is very different to badges denoting mission, the UN or NATO - they don't have quasi-Governmental ambitions.\r\nThe EU from its foundation has had an ambition to be a union of states.

The SEND system introduced through the Children and Families Act 2014 is aimed at identifying and meeting a range of diverse needs. Schools should be monitoring the progress of all their pupils and intervening where learning difficulties are identified, providing ‎the 'graduated approach' known as SEN support. This is a cycle of assessment, planning, intervention and review used by schools and colleges to assist them to identify needs and continuously support progress. Schools and colleges are required to use their best endeavours to support children and young people’s needs. \r\n\r\nWhere this approach is applied in a timely and effective way, the majority of children and young people with autism can and do achieve well in their education without an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plan. In January 2018 14.6% of the school population were identified with SEN and just 2.9% of these had an EHC plan. \r\n\r\nIf a child or young person, including those with autism, does not make expected progress in response to the support being provided by the school, or the support required exceeds the school or colleges’ SEND provision, the school or college, or the parents/carers of the child or young person, or the young person themselves, can ask the local authority to carry out an EHC needs assessment, provided one has not taken place in the previous six months. All local authorities have a duty under the Children and Families Act 2014 to carry out assessments and draw up EHC plans where necessary and they must look at each request for an assessment individually. \r\n\r\nMany children and young people with autism do have an EHC plan. 28.2% of all the pupils with EHC plans in January 2018 had autism identified as their primary need, the most common type of need overall (School Census). Out of 119,909 pupils with a primary need of autism, 55% had an EHC plan (or statement) and 45% were on SEN support.  Identification of children with autism who need plans has increased each year since 2010. Children and young people with autism are being identified for EHC plans where necessary. \r\n\r\nChildren and young people with autism have especially benefitted from the person-centred, multi-agency, participative approach of the reformed SEND system and its focus on good progress and successful supported transition to adulthood. The system is based on meeting individuals’ needs rather than the creating mandatory categories of groups of children with SEND.  \r\n\r\nWe have funded the Autism Education Trust (AET) since 2011 to deliver autism awareness and autism training to education staff in early years, schools and further education settings and it has so far reached more than 190,000 people - not just teachers and teaching assistants, but also support staff such as receptionists, dining hall staff and caretakers, encouraging a ‘whole school’ approach to supporting pupils with autism.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education","created_at":"2018-10-30T09:36:02.329Z","updated_at":"2018-10-30T09:36:02.329Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":223075,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/223075.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Reduce VAT to 5% on repairs and approved alterations to listed buildings.","background":"Private listed property owners are preserving much of Britain’s built heritage for future generations, yet many are struggling to maintain and repair their homes.
