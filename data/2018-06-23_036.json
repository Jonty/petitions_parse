All requests to be accepted even if they overlap","additional_details":"I propose we make it legal that if you have 1 or more children under 16 and you request a week off during the school holidays to cover childcare, your company cannot refuse. Currently each company have their own rules around staffing, 1 person off at a time for example. Meaning you need to find a stranger to watch your child and pay for the risky privilege. Companies refuse to pay for cover for that week and we lose out. It helps families financially in a big big way and also stops worry.","state":"open","signature_count":6,"created_at":"2018-04-02T20:08:33.517Z","updated_at":"2018-04-09T17:11:54.158Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-04-09T17:11:48.134Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-04-03T07:32:49.204Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Georgia Roberts","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":212917,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/212917.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Charge a set £5 fee for every use of the NHS (i.e. GPs, ambulance or hospital)","background":"Although we pay a contribution toward the NHS from our wages I feel there should also be a set fee.
