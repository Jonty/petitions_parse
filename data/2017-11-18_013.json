The connotations of these words compound positive and negative notions e.g. good, evil, weddings, funerals, white/black magic. The symbolic representations and emotions we identify with these words subconsciously effect us. \r\n\r\nThis colour system assists in the paradigm of race hierarchy which has led to many irrational comparisons, historical/present animosity, privilege and discrimination amongst people. \r\n\r\nEvery race is unique and has no opposite. Our race identity should be defined solely by our continents of origin (European/African/Asian etc), not colours. This reduces ignorance by connecting a person or group to countries, languages and cultures; qualities we love, share and have in common.","state":"open","signature_count":22,"created_at":"2017-11-10T11:16:58.876Z","updated_at":"2017-11-17T22:04:46.606Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-11-17T12:43:11.277Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-11-10T15:40:26.829Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Aaron Barnett-Clarke","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":203656,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/203656.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Advise the Queen to make the London Borough of Richmond a Royal Borough","background":"Richmond has two existing Royal Palaces (Hampton Court \u0026 Kew Palace) and a rich history of Royal connections, patronage and places.
