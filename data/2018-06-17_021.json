The advantages of 112 are that it is a GPS service.  People who are trying to contact emergency services do not need to know where they are as the 112 service can pin point their location.  Also, people can register their phone number to text an emergency message to 112.  This is crucial in areas where a phone signal is not possible.  The text will get through.","state":"open","signature_count":29,"created_at":"2018-04-08T11:24:47.572Z","updated_at":"2018-05-21T22:27:43.014Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-04-16T16:02:06.862Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-04-10T06:32:47.466Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Malcolm Edward Sweetlove","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":217137,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/217137.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Place Mindfulness in to the UK school Curriculum","background":"As a family fitness business we see the importance in health and well-being and we see a huge gap in a healthy mentality amongst children and adults too.
