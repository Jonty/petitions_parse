Thousands of horses are killed each year in UK slaughterhouses.","state":"open","signature_count":49,"created_at":"2019-01-09T20:48:54.548Z","updated_at":"2019-02-19T16:32:35.433Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2019-01-21T18:42:46.245Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2019-01-09T21:08:30.044Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Caitlin Suttie","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":234558,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/234558.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Conduct an inquiry into the dispute between TOC's and the RMT.","background":"This Petition Calls upon the relevant Secretary of State to exercise his powers under section 215 of the ‘Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992’ to either conduct an inquiry or to appoint a court of inquiry into the running dispute between Train Operating Companies and the RMT!","additional_details":"","state":"open","signature_count":49,"created_at":"2018-12-05T15:06:02.071Z","updated_at":"2019-02-18T12:20:33.641Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2019-01-29T10:15:47.841Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2019-01-19T15:54:46.324Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"michael bradley","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":231764,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/231764.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Review personal independence payment screening for Chronic “invisible” illness","background":"Chronic illness such as Crohn’s disease is on a rapid incline and many people are suffering and left unable to work and support themselves and are living on the edge of homelessness day in day out and It would appear that the DWP wish to completely overlook or dismiss such illnesses as we can walk.","additional_details":"The questions involved are completely irrelevant to illnesses where you can be seen to be able bodied. but illnesses such as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis as well as many others are being completely overlooked due to reasons such as “you can prepare a meal”, “You can shower and clean yourself.” “You can walk 100 meters” but these factors don’t mean that we can hold down a full time job and in some cases even part time.
