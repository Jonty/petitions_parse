We will continue to invest in and support NHS staff to help deliver safe, high quality patient care every day of the week.","details":"We know NHS staff work incredibly hard to provide outstanding patient care around the clock. Patient safety is the absolute priority for NHS staff and the Government.  That is why our manifesto committed to improve patient care across 7 days of the week, with a particular focus on emergency and urgent care at weekends. The current medical contracts were drawn up in the early 2000s, and there is widespread consensus that they now require reform, partly in order to support improvements in urgent and emergency weekend care through more modern and flexible contractual arrangements. We have been trying for 4 years to agree the necessary changes with the doctors’ trade union, the BMA. Sadly, despite undertaking 3 independent processes to try to reach a negotiated solution, it has not been possible. The contract we are therefore introducing was recommended by one of the NHS’ most successful and respected Chief Executives, Sir David Dalton. He was commissioned at the end of 2015 to lead negotiations on behalf of the NHS with authority to compromise on every issue under discussion. He successfully reached agreement with the BMA on approximately 90% of issues on the table, leaving the final unresolved issue of Saturday pay rates. The process Sir David undertook followed 2 previous independent processes. Last July the DDDRB published recommendations following representations from both sides. The BMA refused even to discuss their recommendations and balloted for strike action on the back of them. Last December the Government and NHS entered detailed discussions with the BMA through ACAS and agreed Heads of Terms to achieve a negotiated solution. Unfortunately, despite agreeing to discuss Saturday pay rates, the BMA reneged and refused to contemplate any compromise on this issue. Sir David advised that a negotiated solution to the outstanding contractual issues was impossible. He also advised that the health service now needs certainty, and as such the Government decided that the only plausible option was to press ahead with the introduction of new contracts. Changes will not be imposed on staff who currently have a contract of employment, but new terms will be offered as juniors enter or move through training and onto new contracts as current contracts expire. This is simply exercising a right that employers have when unable to reach agreement on changes with trade unions. It would not be practical or democratic to allow any trade union to exercise a veto over reforms that support the delivery of the elected Government’s manifesto commitments.The new contract is safer for patients and fairer for doctors. Tired doctors risk patient safety, so in the new contract the maximum number of hours that can be worked in one week will be reduced from 91 to 72; the maximum consecutive nights will be reduced from 7 to 4; the maximum consecutive long days will be reduced from 7 to 5; and no doctor will ever be required to be rostered consecutive weekends. We will also introduce a new ‘Guardian’ role within every Trust with the authority to impose fines for breaches to agreed working hours.  These fines will be invested in educational resources and facilities for trainees.\r\n\r\nThe new contract will give additional pay to those working Saturday evenings from 5pm, nights from 9pm to 7am, and all day on Sunday. Plain time hours will now be extended from 7am to 5pm on Saturdays. However the government was willing to be flexible on Saturday premium pay and we have been: those working 1 in 4 or more Saturdays will receive a pay premium of 30%, higher on average than that available to nurses, midwives, paramedics and most other clinical staff. It is also a higher premium than that available to fire officers, police officers or those in many other walks of life. None the less it does represent a reduction compared to current rates, necessary to ensure hospitals can afford additional weekend rostering. So because we do not want take home pay to go down for junior doctors, these changes will allow an increase of 13.5%. Three quarters of doctors will see a take home pay rise and no trainee working within contracted hours will have their pay cut.\r\n\r\nWe recognise the negotiation process has uncovered some wider and more deep-seated issues relating to junior doctors’ wellbeing and quality of life that need to be addressed. These issues include inflexibility around leave, lack of notice about placements that can be a long way away from home, separation from spouses and families, and sometimes inadequate support from employers, professional bodies and senior clinicians. The Government has therefore asked Prof. Dame Sue Bailey, President of the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges to lead a review of measures outside the contract to improve morale of junior doctors. The Government has committed an extra £10billion to the NHS this Parliament, but with that extra funding must come reform to deliver safer services for patients across all 7 days of the week.","created_at":"2016-03-17T15:00:53.898Z","updated_at":"2016-03-17T15:00:53.898Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":null,"transcript_url":"","video_url":"","overview":"The House of Commons Petitions Committee has decided not to schedule a debate on this petition, because the Committee does not have the power to schedule debates on motions of no confidence, and the petition does not contain a specific request for action on policy. \r\n\r\nIt is usually more effective to start a petition calling for a specific change to government policy or the law, rather than a petition about an individual Minister.

The government is keeping its promise to the electorate, tackling global challenges in the national interest.\r\n\r\nBritain faces a simple choice: either we wait for the problems of the world to arrive on our doorstep, or we take action to tackle them at source.\r\n\r\nUK aid, whether it is helping to prevent deadly diseases like Ebola from coming to the UK from West Africa, or enabling Syrian refugees and other would-be migrants to stay in their home region, is about creating a more stable and secure world.\r\n\r\nOver the last five years, UK aid has been life-saving and life-changing for millions of the poorest people around the world. We have supported 11 million children through school. We have helped more than 60 million people get access to clean water, better sanitation and improved hygiene conditions. We are leading the global effort to save millions of girls from child marriage and Female Genital Mutilation.\r\n\r\nUK aid is spent where it is most needed and is subject to rigorous internal and external checks and scrutiny at all stages. The UK’s aid programmes are scrutinised by the Independent Commission for Aid Impact, the International Development Select Committee and Public Accounts Committee in Parliament, and the National Audit Office. This is in addition to internal monitoring and evaluation to ensure projects stay on track and deliver value for taxpayers’ money.\r\n\r\nThe government has realigned the UK’s aid strategy, cutting wasteful programmes and making sure spending is firmly in the UK’s national interest. Alongside an increased defence budget and the UK’s world class diplomatic service, our aid programme is helping to create a more prosperous and stable world in which the UK can stand tall and flourish.\r\n\r\nBritain’s aid strategy recognises that tackling poverty overseas means tackling the root causes of global problems that affect all of us, such as disease, migration, and terrorism. The Department for International Development is the UK’s primary channel for aid, but to respond to the changing world, more aid will be administered by other government departments, such as the Home Office, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Department of Health, and Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, drawing on their complementary skills.\r\n\r\nThe government will invest more through its aid programme to tackle the causes of instability, insecurity and conflict, and to tackle crime and corruption.

The Government is committed to reducing all school absence unless there are unavoidable reasons.","details":"The Government has focused on reducing absence in schools so that every pupil receives an education that allows them to reach their full potential. \r\n\r\nResearch shows that the amount of time missed from school is linked with a pupil’s academic success. The most recent research ‘The link between absence and attainment at key stage 2 and key stage 4: 2013 to 2014 academic year’(1)  was published by the Department for Education on 24 March 2016, and shows that every extra day of school missed can affect a child’s attainment at the end of key stage 2 and key stage 4. Missing school unnecessarily is unfair to children as it can damage their life chances.\r\n\r\nThe Government acknowledges that family holidays can be enriching experiences. The school year is designed to give families multiple opportunities to enjoy holidays without disrupting their children’s education. Parents should plan their holidays around school breaks and avoid taking their children out of school during term-time, except in exceptional circumstances. Head teachers know their pupils best and are best placed to make these decisions by considering the merits of each request and deciding whether or not it qualifies as an exceptional circumstance. \r\n\r\nIn 2013, the Government clarified the law that enables head teachers to authorise a leave of absence, allowing for term-time holidays in exceptional circumstances only. There was previously a widespread misconception that parents were entitled to take their children on holiday during term-time. No such entitlement has ever existed in law. The misconception had been created by the previous allowance for head teachers to grant up to 10 days of leave for ‘special circumstances’. \r\n\r\nTo address unauthorised absence the Government increased the financial penalty parents must pay for their child’s unauthorised absence, shortened the time permitted to pay a penalty notice from 42 days to 28 days and placed a greater emphasis on school attendance levels in inspection outcomes. \r\n\r\nAs a consequence, the number of persistent absentees in England’s schools has dropped by over 40%, from 433,000 in 2009/10 to 246,000 in 2014/15. Some 6 million fewer days were lost due to authorised absences in the first six half terms in 2014/15 compared to the equivalent period in 2012/13, a drop from a total of 47.9 million days missed to 41.8 million days missed. Overall absence rates have followed a significant downward trend from 6.5% in the academic year ending in 2007 to 4.6% in the academic year ending in 2015. In 2012/13, 7.0% of all absences were accounted for by authorised term-time holiday. This figure dropped to 2.6% of all absences in 2013/14 and 1.6% of all absences in 2014/15. Overall, this means that, on average, pupils miss fewer days at school than they did in 2010, and therefore are receiving less interruption to their education.\r\n\r\nThe recent High Court judgment (Isle of Wight Council vs. Platt, 13 May 2016), ruling that the magistrates who heard the case did not err in law when determining the attendance of the child, was disappointing. The Government is clear that school attendance is non-negotiable. The Department for Education is therefore providing support to the Isle of Wight Council in their application for permission to appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court judgment.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Minister of State for Schools has written to all schools and local authorities, setting out the importance of good school attendance for raising standards. In his letter, the Minister reminded head teachers of their duty to determine whether or not a request for absence is granted. He also made clear that the High Court’s judgment did not establish that a pupil’s attendance above 90% is regarded as ‘regular’ attendance.\r\n\r\nThe Government will continue to ensure that pupils attend every school day possible. When children take unauthorised absence, they miss vital stepping stones towards understanding curriculum content. The Government’s measures will ensure that pupils receive the maximum amount of schooling possible, helping to ensure that all pupils reach their potential, irrespective of background, ability or aptitude. Improving school attendance will continue to play a central role in our commitment to create a world-class education system in this country.  \r\n\r\n(1) https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/absence-and-attainment-at-key-stages-2-and-4-2013-to-2014\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education","created_at":"2016-07-08T11:49:24.397Z","updated_at":"2016-07-08T11:49:24.397Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":"2016-07-11","transcript_url":"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2016-07-11/debates/1607115000001/SchoolPenaltyFinesAndAuthorisedAbsence","video_url":"http://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/e487aaf6-6065-4c01-93f8-faffaa2fa33d","overview":""}}},{"type":"petition","id":122946,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/122946.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Hold a General Election in 2016","background":"The General Public were purposefully misguided before the 2015 election.The lies David Cameron told before the election have now been widely acknowledged as such, and it is only reasonable that the public should be allowed to vote with full knowledge about his true agenda in 2016.

We believe that good leaders are best placed to raise standards and improve outcomes for children – by running schools and groups of schools, recruiting and retaining high quality teachers, sharing their expertise to support other schools, and working together in MATs, while being held to account for rigorous, well-measured outcomes. \r\n\r\nSchools that have chosen to convert to academy status are obtaining better GCSE results and are more likely to be rated good or outstanding by Ofsted. 2015 results show primary, sponsored academies open for two years have improved their results, on average, by 10 percentage points since opening - double the rate of improvement in LA maintained schools over the last two years.\r\n\r\nAs Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector (HMCI) set out in the latest Ofsted annual report, academisation can lead to rapid improvements. In his letter of 10th March to the Secretary of State, HMCI confirmed his belief that it is right to give more autonomy to the front line and that there are some excellent MATs that have made remarkable progress in some of the toughest areas of the country.\r\n \r\nWe expect the majority of schools to join trusts or small local clusters, pupils. MATs are a stronger form of school body than those available to maintained schools, with a single point of accountability. There are many benefits for schools in joining a MAT, including that they can spend less on administration and so invest more in teachers; there are better options for staff development, recruitment and retention; and they can be more responsive to the individual needs of pupils.\r\n\r\nAcademy trusts are free from local and central government intervention so long as performance across education, finance and governance is above certain thresholds. Schools won’t be allowed to linger on, under-performing for many years. Where evidence is found that the school is coasting or failing, government will intervene promptly; however, trusts performing well will be left to run their schools as they see fit.  \r\n\r\nThe vast majority of schools which have become academies are now thriving. In the minority of academies that underperform, swift action has been taken to secure improvements. In total, we have issued 159 formal notices to underperforming academies and free schools and have moved to change the sponsor in 144 cases of particular concern (as at 4 July).\r\n\r\nThe Education and Adoption Act ensures we have powers to hold all academies to account where they do not meet the high standards we expect and create a more consistent framework for tackling underperformance.\r\n\r\nAcademy trusts have statutory responsibilities under company and charity law and also explicit accountabilities to Parliament. They must prepare financial statements each year which are audited by an independent external auditor. This means they receive greater scrutiny than most other types of schools.  These statements are published, allowing the wider public the chance to hold academy trusts to account.\r\n\r\nNo school acquires the freehold of its land as a result of becoming an academy. Most academies will continue to occupy their land on a lease which gives the individual school no powers to sell the land or change its use. Some schools already own their own land before they become academies, and they will continue to hold it. However no-one can sell or change the use of publicly funded education land or buildings without the Secretary of State’s permission.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education","created_at":"2016-07-06T13:24:31.334Z","updated_at":"2016-07-06T13:24:31.334Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":null,"transcript_url":"","video_url":"","overview":"The Committee decided not to schedule a debate on this petition because the House of Commons debated the Education White Paper, which includes the Government's policy on academies, on Wednesday 13 April.

Government is doing all it can to ensure UK steel has a viable future.","details":"The UK steel sector is facing unparalleled global economic conditions.  Around the world, production of steel is 30 per cent higher than demand.  In China alone, excess steel capacity is 25 times the UK’s entire annual production.  India, Indonesia and other emerging economies are ramping up production with ready supplies of raw materials and low-paid labour.  In Europe, demand has yet to return to pre-crash levels.  When unprecedented supply is met with sluggish demand, prices inevitably fall - the international price of steel has halved over the past 18 months.\r\n\r\nThese conditions have led to many companies having to take difficult commercial decisions including redundancies across the sector and the closure of the SSI steel plant in Teesside last year.  This issue is not just a UK issue.  Since 2008 there have been many plant closures across Europe, and the number of workers in European steel manufacturing has fallen by about 70,000.\r\n\r\nThe Government has been working hard with the industry to provide all the support we can. Back in October last year Sajid Javid, Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills convened a special Steel Summit in Rotherham, alongside industry, Scottish and Welsh governments and unions.  Through three Minister-led Working Groups we have been working with the sector to tackle key industry asks.  This is now being taken forward through the Steel Council which had its first meeting on 2 March and will be meeting again soon to discuss recent developments.\r\n\r\nTo date we have paid over £160 million to steel companies and other Energy Intensive Industries (EIIs) to compensate for the cost of climate change-related energy costs, including more than £50 million to Tata.  Following state aid clearance in December we have made the first payments under the latest scheme.  We are also going further, as announced at Autumn Statement, we plan to exempt EIIs from renewable energy costs.  This will save the steel industry over £400m by the end of this Parliament.  We have also secured flexibility over the implementation of EU emissions regulations; this will save the steel industry millions of pounds.\r\n\r\nLast year we published new procurement guidance for central Government Departments, this ensures that social and economic issues are taken into account when Government procures steel.  We are the first Government in the EU to take advantage of this flexibility. We have now gone further and extended this guidance across the entire public sector and will setting up a list of approved steel suppliers.  We also continue to work with all UK steel companies to ensure that they have maximum visibility of the public procurement pipeline.\r\n\r\nWe must remember that many of the issues facing the UK steel industry are international and therefore require an international response.  This is why Sajid Javid asked for and secured an extraordinary meeting of the EU Competitiveness Council to coordinate a continent-wide approach.  We voted in favour of anti-dumping measures on wire rod and on steel pipes in July and October last year.  We have lobbied successfully for an EU investigation into cheap imports of Reinforcing Steel Bar (‘rebar’) and in February we voted in favour of measures on rebar and cold-rolled products.  We also continue to press for the speeding up of trade defence investigations.  Although it is too early to tell what the impact of the duties will be, signs are promising for measures imposed in January; imports of rebar in January 2016 were 99% down on January 2015.\r\n\r\nThe Government recognises that this is a difficult time for the workers and communities affected by the current crisis, including in many areas where the steel sector makes up a substantial part of local employment.  Our immediate focus is to help those who have lost their jobs back into work as quickly as possible.  We have set aside up to £90m of support packages, and are working with Taskforces in Scunthorpe, Rotherham, Scotland and Wales to ensure we are offering all possible support to those affected.\r\n\r\nWhilst we are looking at all viable options and are not ruling anything out, we don't believe nationalisation is the right answer.  The world’s best steel companies all operate in the private sector and public ownership of steel operations has all but disappeared in the EU.  We will support the steel industry where we reasonably can but Government ownership of the steel industry, or any part of it, will not raise prices or increase demand for steel.\r\n\r\nThe Government is doing all it can to ensure a sustainable future for UK steel.  Ministers wrote to MPs to update them during recess and will continue to hold briefings to update representatives of other parties on the situation.  Our focus is on finding a long-term sustainable future for steel-making at Port Talbot and across the UK.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Innovation and Skills","created_at":"2016-04-08T10:24:32.894Z","updated_at":"2016-04-08T10:25:52.380Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":null,"transcript_url":"","video_url":"","overview":"The Committee decided not to schedule a debate on this petition because the House of Commons debated the UK steel industry on 12 April, following an application from Angela Eagle MP for an emergency debate. \r\n\r\nYou can watch the debate here: http://parliamentlive.tv/event/index/d1cd4828-eacb-4afe-b313-9e9c4d63d2e8?in=12:51:40\r\n\r\nYou can read the transcript here: https://hansard.digiminster.com/commons/2016-04-12/debates/16041234000002/UKSteelIndustry"}}},{"type":"petition","id":124702,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/124702.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Scrap plans to force state schools to become academies.","background":"State schools are accountable to parents, the local community and to local authorities.

","details":"Since the launch of this petition, the Government has listened to feedback from teachers, school leaders and parents, as well as MPs. It is clear from those conversations that the impact academies have in transforming young people’s life chances is widely accepted and that more and more schools are keen to embrace academy status. As a result of these conversations the Government has decided, while reaffirming our continued determination to see all schools to become academies in the next six years, that it is not necessary to bring legislation to bring about blanket conversion of all schools to achieve this goal. \r\n\r\nThe Government will continue to require underperforming schools to convert to academy status, and to support good schools to convert and take the lead in supporting other schools as part of multi-academy trusts.

However, there is still more to do.\r\n\r\nIn academies, the best school leaders are free to innovate and run their schools how they choose. Schools don’t have to follow a single ‘right’ way of doing things determined elsewhere; each can develop different approaches that improve outcomes for their children and scale what works. Strong schools and leaders are able to spread their influence, and those which are struggling get the help they need. For example, sponsored academies have turned around some of the most challenging schools in some of the most deprived areas of the country to improve outcomes for disadvantaged pupils. \r\n\r\nWe expect the majority of schools to join trusts or small local clusters, pupils. Multi-Academy Trusts (MATs) are a stronger form of school  body than those available to maintained schools, with a single point of accountability. There are many benefits for schools in joining a MAT, including that they can spend less on administration and so invest more in teachers; there are better options for staff development, recruitment and retention; and they can be more responsive to the individual needs of pupils.\r\n\r\nAll schools becoming academies presents a fundamental shift of power from local and central government, giving responsibility to our best school leaders. It assumes they know better than government what works for their own pupils. The most successful local heads running the oversubscribed schools to which every parent wants to send their child will be able to lead the education of more children. We want to build on this success so that every school can benefit from the autonomy and strong accountability of academy status. \r\n\r\nLike all schools, academy performance is completely transparent on Ofsted’s website and DfE’s performance tables – which have been re-designed to be easier to navigate and compare performance. We will go further and publish data on how well MATs are performing to show the value added by a MAT.  Schools should be primarily accountable to parents and governing boards; to make the accountability system more useful for parents and boards, as well as teachers and leaders, we will improve how we collect and disseminate data. Furthermore, all parents need a voice, and this Government is actually increasing academies’ engagement with parents - we will require every academy to put in place arrangements for meaningful engagement with all parents, and to listen to their views and feedback.\r\nIndeed, as Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector (HMCI) set out in the latest Ofsted annual report, academisation can lead to rapid improvements. In his letter of 10th March to the Secretary of State about inspections of academies in MATs, HMCI confirmed his belief that it is right to give more autonomy to the front line and that there are some excellent MATs that have made remarkable progress in some of the toughest areas of the country.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of schools which have become academies are now thriving.

This change only affects new claims from April 2017 and no current claimants will be cash losers.","details":"In the Summer Budget 2015, we announced that, from April 2017, new Employment Support Allowance (ESA) claimants who are placed in the work-related activity group (WRAG) will receive the same rate of benefit as those claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA). \r\n\r\nThis change only affects new claims made after that date and there will be no cash losers among those who are already in receipt of ESA. This reform affects those with limited capability for work. Those with the most severe work-limiting health conditions and disabilities, who are placed in the Support Group, will be completely unaffected by these changes.\r\n\r\nThe reason for implementing this reform is clear. The current system fails to provide the right support to help those with health conditions and disabilities towards and into work, and acts to trap people on welfare. We are committed to ensuring that people have the best support possible, and that is what these changes are about.\r\n\r\nThe recent record employment levels have benefitted many but have yet to reach those on ESA.  It is important to remember that whilst 1 in 5 JSA claimants move off benefit every month, only 1 in 100 of ESA WRAG claimants does so.  Those with health conditions and disabilities deserve better than this. \r\n\r\nIn addition to providing financial security for individuals, work often has a profound effect on people’s life chances and it is right that this Government does everything it can to provide better support to get people into work.  More than three-fifths (61 per cent) of those in the ESA WRAG say they want to work – and there is a large body of evidence showing that work is generally good for physical and mental wellbeing. \r\n\r\nThis change enables us to recycle money into providing practical support that will make a significant difference to the life chances of those in the WRAG. This new funding will be worth £60 million in 2017/18 rising to £100 million in 2020/21 and will support those with limited capability for work to move towards and into suitable employment. \r\n\r\nAs set out in the Budget 2016, the nature of this support is being influenced by a Taskforce of disability charities, employers, think tanks, provider representatives and local authorities. Furthermore, we are providing a further £15 million for the Jobcentre Plus Flexible Support Fund in 2017-18 to help claimants who have limited capability for work with the extra costs that can be involved in moving closer to the labour market and into work.\r\n\r\nThese changes are part of a wider reform to help support more disabled people and those with health conditions work and to remain in work. Over the coming year we will build the progress we have made in partnership with disabled people, their representatives, and healthcare professionals, using their insights to understand how the welfare system can work better with the health and social care systems.\r\n\r\nOur reforms are aimed at improving the quality of life of those in greatest need.  Again, it is worth noting that we spend around £50 billion every year on benefits to support people with disabilities or health conditions, which represents over 6 per cent of all Government spending. We are proud of that commitment and we are determined to ensure that those most in need continue to receive the support they require. \r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions","created_at":"2016-03-22T13:06:30.114Z","updated_at":"2016-03-23T16:15:43.811Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":null,"transcript_url":"","video_url":"","overview":"The House of Commons Petitions Committee has decided not to schedule a debate on this petition, because this subject has already been discussed and voted on in the House of Commons. \r\n \r\nThe changes to ESA were proposed in the Welfare Reform and Work Bill, which has been debated in both Houses of Parliament.

Graduates generally benefit from higher earnings than those who do not go to university, and we must maintain a fair balance between taxpayers and graduates in the costs of Higher Education. \r\n\r\nGraduates don’t have to repay their loans until they are earning above the annual threshold of £21,000. This threshold remains higher in real terms than that applicable to student loans taken out before 2012. Repayments are then made at a rate of 9% above this threshold. If a borrower earns less than the threshold then no repayments need to be made. Outstanding loans are written off 30 years after graduation.\r\n\r\nThe Government consulted on the threshold freeze in July 2015. All responses to the consultation were considered carefully in the wider context of the detailed analysis of impacts, including on the public finances, and the Equality Analysis. The consultation document and the Government response are available at https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/freezing-the-student-loan-repayment-threshold.\r\n\r\nThe decision to freeze the student loan repayment threshold for post-2012 (“Plan 2”) borrowers until April 2021, was then announced in the November 2015 Spending Review.

NHS Improvement expects employers to introduce a fairer, safer contract, which they can do for new staff and as contracts expire as juniors move through training. ","details":"Junior doctors work incredibly hard across seven days.  They make a huge contribution to the NHS and deserve a fair, professional contract that supports patient care and proper training. As NHS Employers and the British Medical Association (BMA) agreed some years ago, the current contract does not do this and needs to be replaced. Regrettably, despite negotiations over three years and agreement on 90% of the content, a settlement could not be reached and a new contract now needs to be introduced. The new deal is one which NHS leaders are clear is safe, fair and reasonable for junior doctors. Patient safety is the absolute priority for the Government and NHS Employers.  We want to ensure we have the safest healthcare system in the world by introducing stronger limits on junior doctors’ hours and by ensuring that consultants are available to make vital decisions about patient care across seven days. This requires changes to contracts.\r\n \r\nTogether, consultants and junior doctors are crucial to ensuring patients receive the high-quality care they need every day of the week. The BMA called for reform of the junior doctors’ contract in 2008. The proposals put forward for reforming the junior doctors’ contract and the consultants’ contract are designed to protect the safety of junior doctors and patients as well as rewarding junior doctors more fairly and ensuring more consultant availability over weekends to support training and deliver the key clinical standards. We have been making every effort, in good faith, to work with the BMA to introduce a new contract for junior doctors that supports these principles while maintaining average pay and ensuring no doctor is required to work longer or unsafe hours.  After the BMA walked away from negotiations with NHS Employers in 2014, we and NHS Employers accepted the recommendations of the independent Review Body on Doctors’ and Dentists’ Remuneration in July 2015 and sought a return to negotiations. The BMA refused to negotiate, rejected an offer published and sent to junior doctors on 4 November 2015, and balloted for industrial action. \r\n \r\nThe BMA, NHS Employers and the Department agreed, in November, to talks under the auspices of ACAS and this led to negotiations during December. Initial talks led to a revised offer on 4 January, which the BMA refused to discuss, instead announcing that industrial action would commence on 12 January.. The Secretary of State appointed Sir David Dalton, a respected trust chief executive, to lead further talks behalf of the NHS and the Department. At the request of the management side, ACAS were asked to oversee those talks that continued during January with the BMA suspending further action that had been planned for 26-28 January\r\n\r\nOn 1 February Sir David Dalton wrote to the Secretary of State to advise him of the progress of negotiations. At the same time, the BMA announced industrial action for 10 February – with junior doctors providing emergency cover only, rather than the full withdrawal of labour that had previously been announced. This action was regrettable and unnecessary, given that Sir David’s letter showed that the parties had reached agreement on many issues, most notably on safety and on education and training, and on many elements of a new pay structure. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, despite agreeing to discuss Saturday pay rates, the BMA reneged and refused to contemplate any compromise on this issue. Sir David advised that a negotiated solution to the outstanding contractual issues was impossible. He also advised that the health service now needs certainty, and as such the Government decided that the only plausible option was to press ahead with the introduction of new contracts.\r\n\r\nThe Health Secretary announced on 11 February that the new contract will be introduced. NHS Improvement has made clear that it expects all employers to work with their junior doctors to implement the new contract. Changes will not be imposed on staff who currently have a contract of employment, but new terms will be offered as juniors enter training or as they move through training and onto new contracts of employment as current contracts expire. This is simply exercising a right that employers have when unable to reach agreement on changes with Trade Unions. Sir David has made clear his view that a negotiated settlement is not possible and that the proposed contract will be both safer for patients and fair and reasonable for junior doctors. Junior doctors should consider the detail that has been sent to them and published. What will be introduced is a fairer, safer contract that: includes lower limits on working hours and stronger safeguards to enforce these; better supports training; preserves average earnings, including for new trainees; includes a 13.5% increase in basic pensionable pay for all; means an increase in earnings for 75% of those moving onto new terms; and includes an offer that protects the pay of all trainees during transition.","created_at":"2016-03-18T12:21:48.381Z","updated_at":"2016-03-18T12:21:48.381Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":"2016-03-21","transcript_url":"http://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2016-03-21/debates/16032112000001/BMA(ContractNegotiations)","video_url":"http://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/641c6fb7-a2a0-47e0-8b10-e3c99e765c2b","overview":""}}},{"type":"petition","id":133618,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/133618.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Invoke Article 50 of The Lisbon Treaty immediately.","background":"The British people have spoken.

The very nature of this amendment means we must take the time to consult others before bringing final proposals on how to implement.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, the UK continues to take a comprehensive approach to the Syria conflict and migration crisis by providing significant aid and assistance; including our resettlement programmes.  On 4 February 2016, the Prime Minister announced that the UK will more than double our total pledge to the Syria crisis from £1.12 billion to over £2.3 billion.  This is our largest ever response to a single humanitarian crisis.  The Syrian Resettlement Scheme has already provided safe haven to more than 1000 vulnerable Syrians – around half of them children - and overall we expect children to make up a significant proportion of the 20,000 resettlement places we are providing to this group.\r\n\r\nAs announced on 21 April, we have worked closely with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to design a resettlement scheme that will protect the most vulnerable children. The new scheme has been designed with the UNHCR to resettle ‘children at risk’ from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.  The Government has committed to resettling several hundred individuals in the first year with a view to resettling up to 3000 individuals over the lifetime of this Parliament, the majority of which will be children, where the UNHCR deem it to be in their best interests. Children who are identified as at risk will be resettled with their family members or carers where appropriate.  There will be a review of the scheme at the two year mark.\r\n\r\nThis unique initiative will be the largest resettlement effort that focuses on children at risk from the MENA region.  The new scheme will be in addition to the Prime Minister’s commitment to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees. It is also in addition to our other existing resettlement schemes. \r\n\r\nIn regards to Europe, we are providing significant assistance to Member States facing particular pressures to ensure that all refugees can have effective access to protection, wherever they are.   The UK is the largest bilateral contributor to the humanitarian response to the crisis in Europe and the Balkans with a total contribution of £65m.  This includes nearly £46 million to provide life-saving aid to migrants and refugees including food, water, hygiene kits and infant packs, and protection for the most vulnerable, as well as support to organisations helping governments build their capacity to manage arrivals in Greece and the Balkans. The efforts of the partners we fund are targeted to reach the most vulnerable - including children.\r\n\r\nIt also includes the £10m Refugee Children Fund the Department for International Development (DFID) has created to support the needs of vulnerable refugee and migrant children specifically in Europe.

In primary school this means ensuring that they master the basics of maths, reading and writing, preparing them for the challenges of the secondary school curriculum. Parents rightly expect that we check that young people are mastering these vital skills and that schools are held to account where young people have not done so.\r\n\r\nWe have set a more a challenging standard for tests at the end of Key Stage 2 to reflect the high expectations of the new national curriculum. Previous expectations for children were too low and below those of our international competitors.  \r\n\r\nThe tests do, however, measure attainment across the range of ability in assessing pupils’ knowledge and understanding of the national curriculum. The easiest questions in the tests remain of a similar standard to the easiest questions in the old tests. There are some more difficult questions at the top end of the scale to stretch more able pupils that replace the old level 6 tests. Furthermore, while it is important for parents and teachers to understand how children are performing in relation to national expectations, statutory tests only form part of the broader assessments that schools make on an ongoing basis.\r\n\r\nChanges to the national curriculum tests were first announced in March 2014, and since then the Department for Education and Standards and Testing Agency have provided schools with further information to help them adapt to the assessment arrangements. Sample questions were published in summer 2014 and a full set of sample tests was provided in summer 2015, giving primary schools a year to prepare.\r\n\r\nThe best way to prepare pupils remains to focus on teaching the new national curriculum. As this is the first cohort to have reached the end of the key stage it would not be fair or accurate to set the new scale using data from pupils that had studied the old national curriculum. However, this should not affect schools’ ability to prepare for the test, because each child should be pushed to reach their full potential regardless of where the final scale is set.\r\n\r\nWe recognise that significant reforms like these take time to embed and the Minister of State for Schools has recently written to Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector, Sir Michael Wilshaw, and to Regional Schools Commissioners to emphasise that schools are working to new, more rigorous standards this year. It is right that we have the highest expectations for every child.

That is why all eligible students can apply for an upfront tuition fee loan to meet the full costs of their tuition fees, as well as loans for living costs. \r\n\r\nLoans are only repaid once students are earning over £21,000 a year. Students earning below £21,000 will not have to make repayments.

Higher education institutions are expected to spend £745 million through these access agreements in 2016/17, this has risen from £395 in 2009/10.  This will be invested in measures to improve the access to university and successful outcomes of disadvantaged students.\r\n\r\nThe steps we have taken to ensure higher education remains sustainably financed has enabled us to lift student number controls, so that more people have the opportunity to secure a university place. The proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds entering higher education is up from 13.6% in 2009 to 18.5% in 2015. \r\n\r\nLowering tuition fees would carry a number of possible consequences, including a cut to funding for universities and additional demands on public spending, which would be met through higher taxation, including on those who have not themselves benefited from university. This could also mean the re-imposition of student number controls, leading to fewer university places being available for students.]\r\n\r\nThe Government’s approach has struck the right balance between delivering a sustainable system and ensuring higher education remains open and accessible.

The Government’s position is that people should be free to undertake any lawful activities. However, all those involved are encouraged to follow best practice.\r\n\r\nA report by the UK shooting community (Public \u0026 Corporate Economic Consultants report 2014: The Value of Shooting) concludes that the overall environmental and economic impact of game bird shooting is positive, and industry has estimated that £250 million per year is spent on management activities substantially benefiting conservation. For grouse shooting in particular, according to the Moorland Association, estates in England and Wales spend £52.5 million each year on managing 175 grouse moors. The industry also supports 1,520 full time equivalent jobs and is worth £67.7 million in England and Wales.  \r\n\r\nGrouse shooting takes place in upland areas, which are important for delivering a range of valuable “ecosystem services”, including food and fibre, water regulation, carbon storage, biodiversity, and recreational opportunities for health and wellbeing. The Government is committed to helping create a more sustainable future for the English uplands, including by protecting peatlands through measures such as the Peatland Code. \r\n\r\nWith regard to predator control, we welcome the proactive approach taken by game keeping organisations to ensure a sustainable, mutually beneficial relationship between shooting and conservation, for example through the BASC green shoots initiative. Control of grouse predators such as foxes and stoats on shooting estates has a role to play in the recovery of rare or declining species, particularly ground nesting birds. Mountain hares and other tick carrying species such as deer are controlled to reduce disease mortality in infected red grouse chicks. We also recognize that controlling mountain hares and deer is a legitimate practice in other circumstances: for example, to protect young trees and vegetation or as quarry species. \r\n \r\nThe Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 affords protection to all wild birds; despite this, incidents of illegal killing of birds of prey continue, so we have identified raptor persecution as a national wildlife crime priority. Each wildlife crime priority has a delivery group to consider what action should be taken, and develop a plan to prevent crime, gather intelligence on offences and enforce against it. The raptor persecution group, led by a senior police officer, focuses on the golden eagle, goshawk, hen harrier, peregrine, red kite and white tailed eagle and is led by a senior police officer. \r\n\r\nThe National Wildlife Crime Unit, which is part-funded by Defra, monitors and gathers intelligence on illegal activities affecting birds of prey and assists police forces when required. Despite instances of poisoning and killing of birds of prey, populations of many species, such as the peregrine, red kite and buzzard have increased.  \r\n\r\nWith regard to hen harriers, in January 2016 the Defra led Upland Stakeholder Forum hen harrier sub-group published the Joint action plan to increase the English hen harrier population. This sets out six complementary actions to increase hen harrier populations in England. These actions are individually beneficial, and when combined have the potential to deliver stronger outcomes and contribute to the recovery of the hen harrier population in England. These are:\r\n\r\n1: Monitoring of populations in England and UK\r\n\r\n2: Diversionary feeding\r\n\r\n3: Work with Raptor Persecution Priority Delivery Group (RPPDG) to analyse monitoring information and build intelligence picture\r\n\r\n4: Nest and winter roost protection\r\n\r\n5: Southern reintroduction\r\n\r\n6: Trialling a Brood Management Scheme\r\n\r\nThe Action Plan sets out who leads on each action and the timescale and benefits of each. The plan was developed with senior representatives from organisations best placed to take action, including Natural England, the Moorland Association, the National Gamekeepers’ Organisation, the Game \u0026 Wildlife Conservation Trust, National Parks England and the RSPB. These organisations will now take the plan forward led by Natural England.

Much of the content in the unreformed performing arts qualifications is covered in the reformed qualifications of music, drama, and dance, which are ready for first teaching in 2016. As a result of the overlap, the performing arts GCSE is being withdrawn. \r\nHowever, 107 Technical Awards will be available in a wide range of subjects from September 2016, including 6 qualifications in Performing Arts.

They will also strengthen the UK’s world-class capabilities in research and innovation.\r\n\r\nOur higher education sector is among our greatest national assets. England’s universities rank among the best in the world. They generate the knowledge and skills that fuel our economy and provide the basis for our nation’s intellectual and cultural success.\r\n\r\nHowever, our higher education system is falling short when it comes to delivering value for money for students, employers and taxpayers, and is not fulfilling its full potential as an engine of social mobility and driver of enhanced productivity. \r\n\r\nAll students, regardless of their background, deserve excellent teaching that helps them fulfil their potential. The Teaching Excellence Framework will put in place reputational and financial incentives that will drive up the standard of teaching in all universities, and will put clear, understandable information about outcomes in the hands of students so they know where teaching is best and what benefits they can expect to gain from their course. \r\n\t\r\nThe £9,000 fee cap set in 2012 is now worth £8,500 in real terms, and we cannot allow a situation where our world-class universities are under-funded. As is provided for in the 2004 legislation we will therefore allow high quality providers the opportunity to increase the maximum fees in line with inflation, meaning they will remain flat in real terms. \r\n\r\nYoung people from disadvantaged backgrounds have not been put off going to university with entry rates at a record level of 18.5% in 2015 (compared to 13.6% in 2009).

Repayments start only once a student’s income reaches over £21,000. \r\n\r\nWe are committed to maintaining a system which does not allow entry and growth from poor quality and financially unsustainable providers and deals with poor quality providers already in the system.  In order to be eligible for degree awarding powers, a provider must meet tough quality and Financial Sustainability, Management and Governance criteria. And only once a provider has successfully operated with full degree awarding powers for three years will they become eligible for university title. Nonetheless, our reforms will level the playing field for high quality new entrants, improving the capacity and agility of the higher education sector to respond to the needs of students.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Innovation and Skills","created_at":"2016-06-03T11:11:27.756Z","updated_at":"2016-06-03T11:11:27.756Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":150516,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/150516.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make Eid a National Holiday","background":"Make Eid a National Holiday so that British Muslims do not have to use their annual leave or provide them with the option of swapping Christmas day for Eid holiday.","additional_details":"","state":"open","signature_count":50247,"created_at":"2016-06-27T12:22:49.703Z","updated_at":"2016-07-16T23:27:59.712Z","open_at":"2016-06-28T09:10:26.902Z","closed_at":null,"government_response_at":"2016-07-14T09:28:19.956Z","scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"rejected_at":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2016-06-27T15:04:48.433Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2016-06-30T13:31:14.123Z","creator_name":"Moshinur choudhury ","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"The Government has no plans to create another public holiday, or to vary the existing arrangements.

","details":"The Consumer Rights Act 2015 introduced new requirements in relation to the re-sale of tickets through online secondary ticketing facilities for recreational, sporting or cultural events in the UK.  These came into force on 27 May 2015.\r\n\r\nThe Act placed new obligations to provide information about tickets on both ticket re-sellers and the secondary ticketing facilities and are aimed at providing transparency and protection for consumers.  The measures include the duty to provide information about certain connections the seller might have with either the online facility on which they are selling, or the organiser of the event for which the ticket is being sold.  Other consumer legislation requires the identification of the seller, where they are acting as a ‘trader’.\r\n\r\nThe secondary ticketing provisions were introduced in recognition of concerns raised in Parliament that the ticket re-sale secondary market was not functioning correctly and that consumers risked not being sufficiently protected.  \r\n\r\nLocal authority trading standards services have a duty to enforce the secondary\r\nticketing provisions of the 2015 Act in Great Britain (the Department for Enterprise, Trade and Investment is the relevant enforcer for Northern Ireland).  They also enforce other consumer protection legislation, which may be relevant to ticketing.  Suspected or actual breaches of such legislation should first be reported via the Citizens Advice consumer helpline, following which Citizens Advice may refer cases to Trading Standards Services for appropriate action. The Government expects all sellers, secondary ticketing facilities and event organisers to comply with the Act’s secondary ticketing provisions that apply to them, as well as with any other relevant law, including consumer protection, copyright and taxation.    \r\n\r\nIn addition to the obligations described above, the Act required that a review of consumer protection measures should be undertaken. In October 2015, Professor Michael Waterson was appointed to carry out an independent review and his report was published on 26 May 2016:  https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/consumer-protection-measures-applying-to-ticket-resale-waterson-review\r\n\r\nProfessor Waterson considers how tickets come to the secondary market and how pricing, ticketing and venue control are intimately linked. He has recommended a number of practical actions that companies in both the primary and secondary ticket markets could take to increase transparency on ticketing for the consumer.  He believes that the primary ticketing market should do more to protect itself from ‘bots’ that mass purchase tickets, including reporting 'bot' attacks to the Police. And he says the secondary sites should do more to ensure sellers using them comply with the provisions in the Consumer Rights Act 2015. For reasons he sets out in his Report, Professor Waterson is not convinced that price capping is an appropriate solution to issues in the market at this time.\r\n\r\nThe Government will consider Professor Waterson’s Report and respond to it in due course.  \r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Innovation and Skills","created_at":"2016-06-08T14:41:07.050Z","updated_at":"2016-06-08T14:41:07.050Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":128202,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/128202.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Ensure the Education Secretary is a qualified teacher with many years experience","background":"All employers expect their employees to have the relevant qualifications, knowledge and skills in order to be proficient in their work.

This advice can be accessed at: www.gov.uk/government/news/five-simple-steps-to-transform-gardens-in-to-hedgehog-havens\r\n\r\nWe are impressed by the good work of the British Hedgehog Preservation Society and the People’s Trust for Endangered Species in undertaking surveys to establish the facts and engaging the public, and support the majority of their 10 year strategy for the protection of hedgehogs. The Taxon Group, which is being led by Natural England, is also proposing a number of actions that address some of the objectives of the 10 year Strategy.\r\n\r\nHedgehogs are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 from being killed using prohibited methods such as a crossbows, traps and snares. However, further protection of hedgehogs by adding them to Schedule 5 will not support the species and may have unintended consequences because:\r\n\r\no\tthe legislation makes it an offence to intentionally kill, take and injure and we have no evidence that this is currently an issue;\r\no\tprotecting such a generalist habitat from destruction or disturbance could have the unintended consequence of making it a criminal offence to tend gardens; and\r\no\tit may deter the maintenance and creation of habitat for hedgehogs if there will be a restriction on land use as a result.\r\n\r\nSince 2010 we have overseen work to create and restore over 100,000 hectares of priority habitat. Frontline programmes such as our agri-environment schemes have already restored or planted 30,000 kilometres of hedgerows. The new £900 million Countryside Stewardship scheme which started this year will further add to this valuable work by helping farmers, foresters and other land managers play a pivotal role in protection our wildlife and the countryside in general.

Teachers use these tests to inform the judgements they report to parents and the Department about their pupils. \r\n\r\nWe have developed new tests with a more challenging expected standard to align with the high expectations within the new national curriculum. Our reformed education system has been designed to set expectations that match those in the highest performing jurisdictions internationally. Previous national expectations for primary school pupils were too low and left 1 in 3 children starting secondary school unable to read, write and add-up properly. We make no apology for setting high aspirations for all children and encouraging schools to support every one of their pupils to succeed.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that changes to the national curriculum tests were first announced in March 2014, and since then the Department for Education and Standards and Testing Agency have provided schools with further information to help them prepare for the assessment arrangements. In addition to sample questions published in summer 2014, complete sample tests were published in summer 2015 to give primary schools nearly a year of lead-in time to ensure their pupils are adequately prepared. \r\n\r\nWhile the new tests have a more challenging expected standard, they do measure attainment across the range of ability in assessing pupils’ knowledge and understanding of the national curriculum. The easiest questions in the tests remain of a similar standard to the easiest questions in the old tests. There are, however, some more difficult questions at the top end of the scale to stretch more able pupils. Furthermore, it is important for parents and teachers to understand how children are performing in relation to national expectations, but statutory tests only form part of the broader assessments that schools make on an ongoing basis.\r\n\r\nThe removal of national curriculum levels has helped to put classroom assessment back in the hands of teachers by giving schools the freedom to develop their own approaches to assessment within key stages. Levels had a damaging impact on teaching. They encouraging pace over consolidation and incentivising teachers to focus on pupils at level boundaries. Their removal is ensuring that assessment returns to its real purpose of evaluating pupils’ knowledge and understanding of curriculum content. It is allowing teachers to focus on what they do best – teach.

It requires students to study a range of intellectually challenging and substantial whole texts in detail including Shakespeare, 19th-century novels, Romantic poetry, and fiction or drama from the British Isles from 1914 onwards. The content requires students to study no fewer than 15 poems by at least five different poets, and a minimum of 300 lines of poetry. The assessment arrangements must reflect those requirements and is designed to reward students who have gained a deep understanding of literature and who have read widely throughout the course.\r\n\r\nThe content also requires that students are examined on texts which they have not read previously (‘unseen’ texts).  Students will need to read widely during their studies to prepare them for the ‘unseen’ text in the exam and to be able to compare and contrast a range of texts using ‘relevant quotation and detailed textual references’ to demonstrate the breadth of their understanding of literature. These ‘unseen’ texts might, but do not have to be, by authors whose works students have studied as set texts. \r\n \r\nWe do not expect awarding organisations to give or allow students to have access during their exams to copies of the whole texts they have studied. Exam boards can, however, provide students with relevant extracts. The exam boards have each chosen in their sample assessment materials to provide students with extracts of the texts they have studied. \r\n\r\nStudents will not achieve high marks in GCSE English Literature simply by memorising and writing out the poems or texts they have studied.

In addition, the UK Minister for Aviation wrote to Transport Ministers of other EU Member States to ask them to take the opportunity provided by this change in regulation to consider, where appropriate, adopting this alternative to hand search, particularly in respect of religious and cultural headgear.\r\n\r\nThis method of screening allows security officers to conduct searches with more sensitivity not only in the case of Religious/Cultural Headgear, but also for example, in the searching of plaster casts and prostheses. \r\n\r\nHowever, it must also be emphasised that the hand search is still an option in all countries, and there may be circumstances where a security officer will require a hand search or even complete removal of a turban in order to satisfy himself that no prohibited articles are being carried onto an aircraft.

They will ensure there is transparency, and proper levels of scrutiny and oversight in the arrangements for the counting of votes at the referendum.   \r\n\r\nThe Chief Counting Officer is responsible for the conduct of the referendum and ensuring the accuracy of the overall result.  For the referendum, Jenny Watson, chair of the Electoral Commission, which is independent of Government, will be the Chief Counting Officer. She will be assisted by a number of Regional Counting Officers. \r\n\r\nCounting Officers administer the voting and counting processes in their local voting areas. Their duties include issuing ballot papers, running polling stations and counting the votes cast in their area. \r\nCounting Officers and their staff will have had experience of running previous elections and referendums, including other national polls such as UK Parliamentary general elections. \r\n\r\nEach Counting Officer will count the votes cast in their voting area.  Counting Officers will be required to inform their Regional Counting Officer (or the Chief Counting Officer, where a Regional Counting Officer is not appointed, as in Northern Ireland) of the local result once the votes have been counted.  Counting Officers will certify the local result and make a public declaration as to the votes cast when directed to do so by the Regional Counting Officer (or Chief Counting Officer). \r\n\r\nThere is provision for each permitted participant (or referendum campaigner) to appoint referendum agents who may attend each local count, and referendum agents may appoint counting agents to attend each count in order to observe proceedings (i.e. the verification and counting of ballot papers).  Counting Officers are responsible for adjudicating on any doubtful ballot papers and may reject a ballot paper on certain grounds, for example, where the voter’s intention is not certain.  Counting Officers are required to endorse the word “rejected” on any ballot paper which he/she decides is not be counted, and must add the words “rejection objected to” if an objection is made by a counting agent.\r\n\r\nCounting agents may ask to have the votes for their voting area re-counted, which the Counting Officer will agree to if, in the Counting Officer’s opinion, the request is reasonable in the circumstances.  \r\n\r\nGuidance that the Electoral Commission has issued on administering the referendum advises that Counting Officers should share the provisional local totals with the referendum and counting agents, and make clear that they are entitled to request a re-count. This should be undertaken within the framework of maximum openness and transparency so that all campaigners and agents can have confidence in the processes and the provisional local totals provided.\r\n\r\nThere is also provision for a Regional Counting Officer (or the Chief Counting Officer) to direct a Counting Officer to re-count the votes in their voting area if the Regional (or Chief) Counting Officer thinks there is reason to doubt the accuracy of the counting of votes in the voting area.  \r\n\r\nA Counting Officer may not conduct a re-count once a direction has been given by the Regional Counting Officer (or Chief Counting Officer) to certify the local result.  \r\n\r\nThe Electoral Commission’s guidance makes clear that accurate local totals for each voting area are fundamental to an accurate result in which voters can have confidence, and that re-counts can only take place at voting area level.  The Commission advises Counting Officers to make it clear to agents when sharing provisional local totals with them that this is their opportunity to request a re-count and that there is no provision for regional or national re-counts.  This approach is consistent with that taken at UK general elections, the Parliamentary Voting System referendum in 2011 and the Scottish Independence referendum in 2014.\r\n\r\nThe usual processes for election and referendum observers will also apply for the EU referendum.  Any individual or organisation can apply to the Electoral Commission for accreditation to be an observer. Authorised observers may observe proceedings at the poll, at the issue and receipt of postal ballot papers, and at the counting of votes.\r\n\r\nForeign and Commonwealth Office","created_at":"2016-04-20T13:49:13.872Z","updated_at":"2016-04-20T13:49:13.872Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":132191,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/132191.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Allow loud call for prayer (Adhan) in UK mosques","background":"The adhan, or Islamic call to prayer, is an integral part of the Muslim faith.

","details":"We were really sorry to hear that Hannah has cystic fibrosis and that she lost her sister Iona to the same terrible disease last year.\r\n\r\nThe pace of biomedical science is putting more pressure on budgets across the developed world all the time as new and increasingly targeted drugs are developed.  These are often expensive and all health systems face difficult decisions about how to prioritise inevitably finite resources.  \r\n\r\nAs part of its remit, the independent National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is responsible for issuing guidance to the NHS on whether selected drugs and treatments represent an effective use of NHS resources.  These are very difficult decisions to make, and NICE’s guidance is based on a thorough assessment of the available evidence and is developed through wide consultation with stakeholders. \r\n\r\nNICE is currently appraising Orkambi (lumacaftor–ivacaftor) for treating cystic fibrosis in people 12 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.  NICE consulted on its draft guidance on the use of Orkambi earlier this year and, after considering the feedback from consultation, NICE published its final draft guidance on 17 June 2016 which does not recommend the treatment. NICE’s Appraisal Committee concluded that the benefits of Orkambi were not sufficient to justify its considerable cost.  Stakeholders had until 1 July 2016 to appeal.  NICE’s final guidance is expected this month.\r\n\r\nNHS commissioners are required to fund drugs and treatments recommended by NICE technology appraisals.  In the absence of NICE guidance, or where negative guidance has been issued, funding decisions should be made by the relevant NHS commissioner, based on an assessment of the available evidence and on the basis of an individual patient’s clinical circumstances.  \r\n\r\nOfficials in the Department of Health are engaging with Vertex Pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of Orkambi, to explore potential proposals, informed by those from the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, that could enable NHS patients to access the drug at a cost-effective price.  They have encouraged Vertex to engage with NICE and NHS England on their proposals.\r\n\r\nIn cases where a company comes forward with a viable scheme proposal that Ministers are able to agree within a specified timescale after NICE publishes final guidance, NICE can undertake a ‘rapid review’ of its technology appraisal guidance and take such scheme proposals into account.\r\n\r\nThe Government is actively looking at what we can do to accelerate the pathway for innovative drugs to reach NHS patients, including those with rare diseases like cystic fibrosis.  The Accelerated Access Review, independently chaired by Sir Hugh Taylor, will make recommendations to Government on speeding up access for NHS patients to innovative and cost-effective new medicines, diagnostics, medical technologies and digital products.  The review’s full report and recommendations are expected this Summer.

The EYFS sets the standards that all early years providers must meet to ensure that children learn and develop well and are kept healthy and safe. It promotes teaching and learning and gives children the broad range of knowledge and skills that provide the right foundation for good future progress through school and life.\r\n\r\nThe areas of learning and development outlined in the EYFS provide the right baseline for the primary national curriculum. The new national curriculum was introduced in September 2014 and is carefully designed to provide a smooth transition from the EYFS to key stage 1.\r\n\r\nThe national curriculum focuses on the essential knowledge that must be taught, allowing teachers to take greater control over the wider curriculum in schools and how it is taught. Teachers will use their professional judgement to decide how best to ensure that their pupils develop important characteristics and skills such as creativity, resilience, independence and risk taking. Extra-curricular activities such as sports clubs, music and drama all help to build character and give younger children opportunities to flourish.\r\n\r\nPupils should not miss out on knowledge and skills development when they start key stage 1. For example, the key stage 1 programme of study for English makes clear that during year 1 teachers should build on work from the EYFS and build on what pupils have already learnt. Where pupils entering year 1 have not met the early learning goals they should continue to follow their school’s curriculum for EYFS to develop the appropriate knowledge and skills to ensure a good grounding for the key stage 1 curriculum.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education","created_at":"2016-03-17T17:30:51.746Z","updated_at":"2016-03-17T17:30:51.746Z"},"debate":null}}]}
