In one incident a dog ran accross a busy road to get to mine, the owner said 'sorry, but he's friendly' - lucky he wasn't 'dead friendly'. I also know personally of several cases where dogs have been attacked by loose dogs, one of which was on their own driveway. Sadly the owners seem to think this is acceptable behaviour.","state":"open","signature_count":18,"created_at":"2018-09-15T22:01:08.171Z","updated_at":"2019-01-18T19:23:15.595Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-09-24T13:16:00.402Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-09-16T19:30:37.605Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Anne Brown","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":228646,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/228646.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Require teachers to wear a uniform","background":"Pupils have to wear uniforms for numerous reasons and if not are punished and sent home even if parents cannot afford it.
