The planning guidance supporting the Framework is clear that the potential effect of a new residential development being located close to an existing business giving rise to noise should be carefully considered.  The guidance underlines planning’s contribution to avoiding future complaints and risks to local business from resulting enforcement action. To help avoid such situations, local councils are encouraged to consider appropriate mitigation including designing the new development to reduce the impact of noise from the local environment and optimising the sound insulation provided by the building envelope.\r\n \r\nOn 6 April, the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) (Amendment) Order 2016 made permanent the permitted development right for the change of use from office to residential.

Options that are suitable for vegans should be made available where individuals request this however any revisions in menu options provided need to reflect the needs of the population served.\r\n\r\nEvery hospital has a responsibility to provide the highest level of care possible for their patients and this, without question, includes the quality and nutritional value of the food that is served and eaten. The NHS Constitution includes the right; ‘You have the right to receive suitable and nutritious food and hydration to sustain good health and wellbeing’, and the constitution handbook sets the expectation that dietary requirements should be reasonably met, whether specific or unusual to an organisation’s general population, for example cultural or religious. This includes the provision of vegan foods.\r\n\r\nIt is a fundamental requirement that prisoners and members of staff are provided with meals which meet an individual’s religious, cultural and medical dietary needs. Consequently, the menu choices and meal provision reflect the religious and cultural needs of the prison.\r\n\r\nThe government’s School Food Standards regulate the food and drink provided at both lunchtime and at other times of the school day.  Beyond this, we believe that head teachers, school governors and caterers are best placed to make decisions about their school food policies, taking into account local circumstances and the needs of their pupils. In doing so, we expect schools to make reasonable adjustments for pupils with particular requirements, for example to reflect dietary and cultural needs. \r\n\r\nLike schools, we would expect further education colleges and providers and higher education institutions, as autonomous organisations which are responsible for making their own decisions on the catering arrangements they have in place for students, to want to make reasonable adjustments for their students with particular requirements, for example to reflect dietary and cultural needs. \r\n\r\nThe issue of diet is complex with many factors including cultural, social and religious influencing the make-up of what we eat. The Government does not aim to undermine these influences, and we see value in encouraging people to think carefully about the environmental impact of the food they eat. While food choices can have an impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, well managed livestock also provide many environmental benefits including supporting biodiversity, protecting the character and identity of the countryside and generating an important income for rural communities.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education","created_at":"2016-12-07T12:32:05.509Z","updated_at":"2016-12-07T12:32:05.509Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":167441,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/167441.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Instruct NHS England to reverse their sudden ban on stem cell transplantation.","background":"Without prior warning, patients receiving lifesaving treatment for a rare form of blood cancer have had their funding for stem cell transplantation withdrawn by NHS England.

The condition is characterised by a slow progression and patients are managed on a case by case basis as symptoms develop. In a small proportion of cases a stem cell transplant is the most appropriate form of treatment. \r\n\r\nNHS England published the criteria used for routine clinical commissioning of stem cell transplants in 2013 which is available at: www.england.nhs.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/b04-p-a.pdf. This commissioning policy for stem transplants reflects the professional consensus on the benefit and risk of a transplant for different conditions that was available when the policy was formulated. In the UK this guidance came from the British Society for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation (BSBMT) in the form of best-practice guides for treatment of adults (2012) and children (2011). This guidance is regularly updated to take account of developments in clinical practice. WM was only added to the guidance in September 2013 and therefore NHS England did not include this condition as part of the overall clinical commissioning policy. This means that NHS England does not routinely commission stem cell treatments for WM patients and that funding of stem cell transplants for these patients has involved other funding mechanisms. Over the last few years some patients have received a stem cell transplant to treat WM. In these cases funding may have involved an Individual Funding Request (IFRs) or been directly funded from an NHS trust.\r\n\r\nEach year, NHS England receives proposals for new drugs, medical devices or interventions for use by specialised services in England. NHS England has to make difficult operational decisions on behalf of tax-payers about how to prioritise the funding that is available for new investments. NHS England needs to ensure it focuses resources on those interventions which deliver the best results for patients, taking into account the evidence for clinical benefit and cost. \r\n\r\nProposals are reviewed by the Clinical Priorities Advisory Group (CPAG) that follows a published procedure. A proposal to routinely commission transplant for patients with WM will be considered by CPAG later this year and NHS Trusts will be informed of the outcome. Until that time, clinicians can continue to apply for funding for stem cell transplant for patient with WM where it can be demonstrated that a transplant is the most appropriate treatment option.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2016-10-12T09:08:43.969Z","updated_at":"2016-10-12T09:08:43.969Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":166442,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/166442.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Please sign the petition for the Robin to become our official National Bird.","background":"This petition is being co-ordinated by David Lindo - also known as The Urban Birder - a natural history broadcaster and writer.

She acknowledged that it had been a difficult decision to make.\r\n\r\nIn determining whether or not to establish a statutory inquiry or other review, the Home Secretary considered a number of factors, reviewed a range of documents, carefully scrutinized the arguments contained in the Campaign’s submission and spoke to members of the Campaign. She concluded that neither an inquiry nor a review was required to allay public concern, more than 30 years after the events in question. In doing so, she noted the following factors:\r\n\r\n•\tDespite the forceful accounts and arguments provided by the campaigners and former miners who were present that day, about the effect that these events have had on them, ultimately there were no deaths or wrongful convictions.\r\n\r\n•\tIn addition, there have been very significant changes to policing since 1984, at every level, including major reforms to criminal procedure, changes to public order policing and practice, stronger external scrutiny and greater local accountability.\r\n\r\nIn particular the operational delivery and practice of public order policing has moved on a great deal from the arrangements in 1984, and tactics have now been reviewed and altered several times both by the police and the courts.\r\n\r\n•\tProtections which were singularly lacking at the time of Orgreave now exist with the introduction of the Police \u0026 Criminal Evidence Act 1984 which has vastly improved the way police investigations and powers operate.\r\n\r\n•\tThe creation of the Crown Prosecution Service in 1986, with the introduction of independent CPS prosecutors, fundamentally altered the prosecution of offences. It ended the existence of ad hoc prosecution arrangements across the country whereby a mixture of police prosecutors and private firms of solicitors - hired by the police and acting for and on the instruction of the police – conducted prosecutions.\r\n•\tWith regards to the external scrutiny of complaints against the police, this was strengthened by the creation, in 1985, of the Police Complaints Authority which was replaced in 2004 by the more effective Independent Police Complaints Commission and in turn will be replaced by the Office for Police Conduct in 2017. The exemplary standards of behaviour expected of everyone who works in policing were reinforced by the introduction of a statutory Code of Ethics, laid before this House in 2014.\r\n\r\n•\tLastly, the introduction of directly elected Police and Crime Commissioners in 2012 has given the public a voice in shaping their local policing priorities and improved the accountability of police leadership.\r\n\r\nAs a result there would therefore be very few lessons for the policing system today to be learned from any review of the events and practices of three decades ago. This is a very important consideration when looking at the necessity for an inquiry or independent review and the public interest to be derived from holding one. Taking these considerations into account, the Home Secretary does not believe that establishing any kind of inquiry is required in the wider public interest concern or for any other reason.\r\n\r\nThe Home Secretary believes that the focus should now be on continuing to ensure that the policing system is the best it can be for the future, including through reforms currently before Parliament in the Policing and Crime Bill, so that the public can have the best possible policing both in South Yorkshire and across the country.\r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2016-11-21T13:54:57.628Z","updated_at":"2016-11-21T13:54:57.628Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":163428,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/163428.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Prevent the closure of the Maternity Unit at Banbury Horton General Hospital","background":"Banbury is one of the largest towns in Oxfordshire and getting bigger.\r\nThe services of the Maternity ward at Horton Banbury save and support babies, mums and families and has done so in the past. \r\nHaving to go to the JR in Oxford is risking way too many lives.

This decision was based on there being insufficient numbers of middle grade obstetric doctors to staff the service safely.  The decision means that maternity services at Horton General Hospital will be offered temporarily by a Midwifery-led Unit (MLU), while efforts continue to fill vacant obstetric posts.   This is an emergency, temporary suspension of consultant-led obstetric and gynaecology services in Banbury from October 2016.

Should recruitment be successful for the middle grade obstetrician posts at the Horton General Hospital between September and October 2016, the trust would anticipate reinstating obstetric services at the Horton General from January 2017, allowing time for recruited staff to start work and for the necessary arrangements for other staff to be made.  If recruitment is not successful in that timescale, recruitment would continue, with potential reinstatement dates moving on by three-month blocks.\r\n \r\nOxfordshire Clinical Commissioning Group (OCCG) advises that it is developing a county wide transformation programme as part of the Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West Sustainability and Transformation Plan (STP) to shape the future of health care.

","details":"The Government is committed to providing secure, affordable and clean energy, now and for the future. We need to replace our ageing infrastructure with low-carbon, reliable energy sources; and aim to do so through a mix of technologies and energy supplies, diversifying supply and reducing reliance on any one energy source. Keeping the lights on is non-negotiable.\r\n\r\nThe Government is clear that nuclear will be an important part of the future generation mix; a transition to a low carbon economy is key to our long term economic and environmental prosperity and, looking at the full costs to consumers, nuclear is both cost-competitive and low carbon. It is the only proven, large scale, low-carbon technology which provides base load supply. Currently, the UK has eight power stations which generate around 20% of electricity in the UK. Almost all of these existing power stations are due to close by 2030, and it is important we start to take action now to replace these.\r\n\r\nFollowing a review of the Hinkley Point C project, the Government has decided to proceed with the first new nuclear power station for a generation, subject to a number of conditions being accepted. Hinkley Point C will kick start a new era of nuclear power - building on Britain’s strong nuclear legacy – and help ensure the UK benefits from a diverse future energy mix designed to give consumers reliable and affordable low carbon energy. It will provide 7% of Britain’s electricity needs for 60 years. UK-based businesses will benefit from more than 60% of the £18 billion value of the project, and 26,000 jobs and apprenticeships will be created.\r\n\r\nThe Government is already committed to the renewable energy sector where it has a proven track record - nearly £52 billion has been invested since 2010. The average annual investment has more than doubled in the last 5 years, with an average of £9 billion invested each year in UK-based renewables. Annual support for renewable technologies will more than double, to over £10 billion, in 2020-21.\r\n\r\nSince 2010, the UK has more than trebled its renewable electricity capacity. Renewables’ share of generation increased by 6 percentage points on 2014 to a record 25% in 2015. For the first time, renewable sources provided more power over the year than coal. We are on track to comfortably exceed our ambition of delivering 30% of the UK’s electricity from renewables in 2020-21.\r\n  \r\nIn addition:\r\n•\tsolar PV has had rapid deployment over the past 5 years, with over 99% of the UKs capacity deployed since 2010 and almost 40% of the capacity (3.7GW) was installed in 2015\r\n•\tbio energy generation was 30% higher in 2015 compared to 2014\r\n•\toverall, wind generation was 26% higher than in 2014 and installed capacity 7.0% higher\r\n\r\nRenewables, such as wind farms, are intermittent and this is why the Government supports a balanced energy policy comprising a mix of sources, such as gas, nuclear and renewables.  With increased use of renewable energy, intermittency will become more of an issue and it is something we are planning for very carefully. We are seeking to keep energy bills down by not over incentivising technologies under low carbon incentive schemes. Furthermore, we are encouraging industry to drive down development costs, which is why the Contracts for Difference (CfD) strike price reduces over time.\r\n\r\nAs costs continue to fall, we will scale back support from sectors and redirect support to technologies where it is needed most. Onshore wind and solar costs have already fallen and so we have reduced support in those areas.\r\n\r\nThe Government is committed to providing investors with certainty and reducing risks for future investors. We are doing this whilst seeking to control costs that fall on consumers and ensuring that the Government’s other energy policy objectives, particularly on security of supply and climate change, are met.\r\n\r\nThe Government is clear that the transition to a low carbon economy is key to our long term economic and environmental prosperity; nuclear is part of that generation mix. Looking at the full costs to consumers, nuclear is cost-competitive and low carbon. Importantly it can provide continuous power, irrespective of whether the wind is blowing or the sun shining.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Business, Energy \u0026 Industrial Strategy","created_at":"2016-09-28T14:29:09.283Z","updated_at":"2016-09-28T14:29:09.283Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":172441,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/172441.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Save our Bass: do not water down the proposal to ban nets.","background":"We are calling on George Eustice, the UK Fisheries Minister, to support the Commission's proposals and not to cave in to commercial pressure like last year, to the anger and dismay of anglers and other conservationists.","additional_details":"Commercial netting has hammered the bass stock.

High needs funding is part of the dedicated schools grant to local authorities, which they can use to support schools with the costs of Special Educational Needs (SEN) provision. This grant funding should not be used for legal services relating to a local authority’s statutory functions.\r\n\r\nThe government gave schools a generous settlement in the last spending review, offering a real terms protection, which means that overall funding for schools rises in line with inflation over the next few years. There is evidence, however, that school funding is not fairly distributed around the country, with some schools managing with much less than others in similar circumstances. \r\n\r\nThe government has said that it will introduce a national funding formula for schools that will distribute funding more fairly. And a national formula for distributing high needs funding as well. There was an initial consultation on this proposal earlier this year, and plans for further consultation later this year. Under any future funding distribution, funding will not be limitless, and schools and local authorities need to be able to manage their budgets in a way that achieves the best for all the children for whom they are responsible, including those with SEN, using the money they have at their disposal carefully, reducing wasteful spending, and focusing on what really adds value.\r\n\r\nChildren and young people should not lose support that is specified in their statements simply because they are being transferred to an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plan. When a local authority is transferring a statement to a plan it is required to carry out a transfer review, which is an EHC needs assessment that will usually replace the annual review for the child or young person. For the vast majority of those with statements, the provision specified should continue to be delivered through their new EHC plan if it is still required in order to meet the outcomes described in the plan.\r\n\r\nThe reforms to the SEN and disability support system were designed to put families and children at its centre, and make it less adversarial. Thanks to the changes, mediation is now available to parents and young people at an early stage and many of them are taking up this service. In 2015 more than 75% of mediation cases were resolved without the need to proceed to an appeal that year. However, the Department takes very seriously the concerns raised about the system remaining too adversarial, despite the progress made since our reforms. We have commissioned the Centre for Educational Development, Appraisal and Research (CEDAR) at the University of Warwick to carry out an in-depth review of the new system of disagreement resolution, which includes mediation and the Tribunal, to make sure that it is working effectively for parents, young people and carers. The Secretary of State and Lord Chancellor will report to Parliament next March on the outcome of the review.\r\n\r\nAppealing to the Tribunal is a right for parents and for young people aged 16 to 25. The SEN and Disability Tribunal emphasises that its aim is to be facilitative and accessible, so that it should not be necessary to employ legal support when making or defending an appeal. It is free to take cases to the Tribunal and no additional weight is given to evidence because it is presented by a lawyer. Many parents successfully pursue their case without legal representation. The Tribunal can also make a contribution to parents, young people and representatives towards out of pocket expenses, such as travel costs, in attending a hearing.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Education","created_at":"2016-12-01T17:30:13.656Z","updated_at":"2016-12-01T17:30:13.656Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":150084,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/150084.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Fast track naturalisation for EU citizens resident in the UK longer than 5 years","background":"In view of the vote to leave the EU, implement a simplified fast track process to naturalise EU citizens who have settled in the UK for at least five years.
