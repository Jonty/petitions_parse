CCCTB would change tax rules so that companies be charged based on where their activity be done â€“ meaning that a company with sales, employment and assets (say, 20% of its European total) in the UK would have to pay UK tax on 20% of its European profits; a far fairer system.","state":"open","signature_count":46,"created_at":"2017-10-27T13:09:03.054Z","updated_at":"2017-11-08T21:20:57.977Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-11-06T12:53:36.014Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-10-29T22:16:57.696Z","response_threshold_reached_at":null,"government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Adam Lawson","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":202600,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/202600.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Hold a General Election if there is no deal on Brexit by September 2018","background":"Leaving the EU without an agreement on our future relationship would be catastrophic in economic and human terms.
