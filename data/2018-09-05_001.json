There can be no attempt to stay in the EU.\r\n\r\nThe result of the referendum held on 23 June 2016 saw a majority of people vote to leave the European Union. This was the biggest democratic mandate for a course of action ever directed at any UK Government. Following this, Parliament authorised the Prime Minister to trigger Article 50, passing the EU (Notification of Withdrawal) Act.\r\n\r\nIn last year’s General Election, over 80% of people then voted for parties committing to respecting the result of the referendum. It was the stated policy of both major parties that the decision of the people would be respected. The Government is clear that it is now its duty to implement the will of the electorate.\r\n\r\nThis was not a decision made after just a few weeks of campaigning, but one that came after a debate that had taken place both in Parliament and across the country for decades. \r\n\r\nWe are committed to making a success of the British people’s decision to leave the European Union.  And that is how we have always approached the negotiations -  anticipating success, not failure. It is vital that we try to reach an agreement that builds a strong relationship between Britain and the EU as neighbours, allies and partners. Not just for those who voted to leave but for every citizen of the United Kingdom. We were given a national mandate and this Government is determined to deliver a deal in the national interest. \r\n\r\nAs the Prime Minister has said: “This is about more than the decision to leave the EU; it is about whether the public can trust their politicians to put in place the decision they took.” The British people can trust this Government to honour the referendum result and get the best deal possible. To do otherwise would be to undermine the decision of the British people. The premise that the people can trust their politicians to deliver on the promises they make and will deliver them in Parliament is fundamental to our democracy. \r\n\r\nOur focus is making a success of Brexit and attempting to get the best deal possible. A deal that is in the interests of both the United Kingdom and the European Union.

However, although it is an offence to keep one of these types of dog there are exemptions for individual dogs where it has been shown to a court that they do not pose a safety risk to others.  The exemptions are subject to conditions (i.e. neutered, insured against injuring third parties, muzzled and on a lead when in public).\r\n\r\nThe Government considers that the prohibition on certain types of dogs forms an important part of the measures needed to tackle irresponsible ownership of dogs. Other important measures already in place include: an offence to allow a dog, of any type or breed, to be dangerously out of control; allowing police and local authorities to issue community protection notices to irresponsible owners whose dogs are causing low level problems; and civil law allowing courts to impose restrictions on individual dogs that are found to be dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe Parliamentary Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (EFRA) (not Government) are currently reviewing the law on the prohibition on certain types of dogs.

It also retained a right of abode for certain Commonwealth citizens. Therefore, everyone that arrived in the UK and was settled before 1973 was given settlement rights by operation of law and was not required to have any specific documentation to prove those rights. \r\n\r\nSince 1973, many of the Windrush generation will have obtained documentation confirming their status or would have applied for citizenship and then a British passport. For those who have not, the former Home Secretary announced a series of measures on 16 and 23 April 2018 to ensure the Windrush generation could easily obtain documentation to demonstrate that right and could easily go on to apply for British Citizenship.\r\n \r\nOn 16 April, the previous Home Secretary announced a dedicated taskforce would be established to support the Windrush generation. The taskforce is taking calls and emails from those who are affected and guiding them through the application taskforce. Since its inception on 17 April the taskforce has documented hundreds of individuals who were affected.\r\n\r\nIn the Westminster Hall debate on this petition, the Minister for Immigration said of the taskforce:\r\n\r\nI was in Croydon and in Sheffield with caseworkers who are on the frontline, doing their best to help people through the process. \r\n\r\nI have to say that I was very impressed with the determination of those caseworkers to be sympathetic and understanding, and to talk people through the process as gently as they possibly could while at the same time enabling them to give their stories and to provide a picture of their life in the UK—helping them through a process with which we should have been helping them much earlier.\r\n\r\nOn 23 April, the previous Home Secretary announced four measures to assist those in the Windrush generation to become British Citizens:\r\n\r\nFirstly, that the Government will waive the citizenship fee for anyone in the Windrush generation who wishes to apply for citizenship. This applies to those who have no current documentation, and also to those who have it.\r\n\r\nSecondly, that the Government will waive the requirement to carry out a Knowledge of Language and Life in the UK test for British Citizenship.\r\n\r\nThirdly, that the children of the Windrush generation who are in the UK and need to apply for naturalisation will have their fee waived.  For those not born in the UK but now living here, provided they joined their parents as children (before the age of 18) they will also be covered by the scheme.\r\n\r\nFourthly, that those who made their lives here but have now retired to their country of origin, are able to come back to the UK, without fees. \r\n\r\nFinally, the Prime Minister and Home Secretary have announced that a compensation scheme will be put in place for those who have suffered loss as a result of these difficulties, and that the Government will consult on the design of this scheme – such as the shape it should take, what it should cover, and how long it should be for. \r\n \r\nAccordingly, the Home Office have launched a call for evidence addressed to those who have been affected by this situation and their families.  This is an opportunity for those people to tell the Government what happened, how it has affected them and what they believe the compensation scheme needs to address.\r\n\r\nAs a first step the Government have asked Martin Forde QC to provide independent oversight and advise us on the design of the scheme. He will help us to understand the experience of people who have been affected and how this should be reflected in the scheme.\r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2018-05-23T11:50:21.008Z","updated_at":"2018-05-23T11:50:21.008Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":"2018-04-30","transcript_url":"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2018-04-30/debates/CEC6AAFF-E02D-41DA-B681-AF9713BE6F82/MinorsEnteringTheUK1948To1971","video_url":"https://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/f29d6e8b-ff66-4e9b-97a6-89dc46a9dbfd","debate_pack_url":"https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CDP-2018-0109","overview":""}}},{"type":"petition","id":219576,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/219576.json"},"attributes":{"action":"British Soldiers who served in N.

It is only due to the courageous efforts of our security forces that we have the relative peace and stability that Northern Ireland enjoys today. Our security forces ensured that Northern Ireland’s future will only ever be decided by democracy and consent, and never by violence. Over 250,000 people served in Northern Ireland during Operation Banner, the longest continuous military deployment in our country’s history, the vast majority with courage, professionalism and great distinction. This Government will never forget the debt of gratitude we owe them.\r\n\r\nCriminal investigations and prosecutions are a matter for the police and prosecuting authorities who act independently of government and politicians. This Government believes in the rule of law.  Where there is evidence of wrongdoing it is right that this should be investigated and, where the evidence exists, for prosecutions to follow. We do not support amnesties or immunity from prosecution. \r\n\r\nThis Government remains committed to the full implementation of the legacy institutions in the Stormont House Agreement of December 2014. The Agreement includes a commitment to establish new legacy institutions, among them a Historical Investigations Unit (HIU) to take forward outstanding investigations into Troubles-related deaths.\r\n\r\nOn 11 May 2018, the UK Government published a consultation paper entitled ‘Addressing the legacy of Northern Ireland’s past’.  The consultation sets out how the institutions are designed to address different aspects of the legacy of the past. The general principles underpinning the proposed new institutions are set out, including the requirement to operate in ways that are balanced, proportionate, transparent, fair and equitable.  The Government believes that these institutions, which represent the balance of a political agreement between all the parties to the Stormont House Agreement provide the best way to address the legacy of Northern Ireland’s past. \r\n\r\nThe HIU will deal with deaths in chronological order. This will ensure terrorist murders, including 185 murders of soldiers, are investigated and any evidential leads pursued. These include the murders of 18 soldiers at Warrenpoint in 1979 and eight in the Ballygawley bus bombing.\r\n\r\nThe HIU would take on the outstanding work of the Police Service of Northern Ireland’s (PSNI’s) Historical Enquiries Team and the outstanding legacy work of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland.  \r\n\r\nIn order to ensure expeditious investigations and to bring an end to investigations into the past, the HIU will be time-limited, with an objective to complete its work in 5 years and specific obligations governing the extent to which a case requires further investigation.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the current investigatory mechanisms, the new institutions will be victim-centred but also include statutory controls on the way that they operate, such as time-limits, strictly defined remits and safeguards to protect national security. These measures aim to bring to a close investigations into the past and have the potential to provide better outcomes for victims and survivors who suffered most during the Troubles.\r\n\r\nNorthern Ireland Office","created_at":"2018-06-11T16:05:07.631Z","updated_at":"2018-06-11T16:05:07.631Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":220162,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/220162.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Give working mums support to pay child care for children between birth - 3yrs","background":"I am a new working mum and I can not believe how expensive child care is, working on the national minimal wage how are mums able to work to cover child care costs when it takes over 3/4 of their wage.

Firstly, ensuring the delivery of good quality childcare that is affordable and available to parents; allowing every child to access early education which is vital to their future. Secondly, supporting parents with the costs of childcare, particularly where it is a barrier to them entering or progressing in work.\r\n\r\nThis government has done more than any other to help parents with childcare costs, spending more than ever before: around £6 billion per year by 2020, and is currently focused on rolling out three significant new childcare measures which will extend childcare support to a wider range of parents.\r\n\r\nGenerous support under Universal Credit (UC) is rolling out now, providing 85% of childcare costs from the first hour of work. Tax-Free Childcare (TFC) is now available to all eligible families - providing fairer and better targeted support. And since September 2017, working parents of 3- and 4-year-olds have been able to access 30 hours free childcare, supporting parents to increase their working hours.\r\n\r\nThe Government is committed to supporting disadvantaged children and closing the development gap. The 2-Year-Old Entitlement, which provides 15 hours per week of free childcare, is available for families in receipt of UC with an annual net earned income up to £15,400 and for families in receipt of other benefits currently qualifying them for free school meals. Also eligible are those receiving working tax credits (with an annual gross household income of no more than £16,190). Children entitled to certain benefits or support for a disability or special educational need, looked after children and certain children who have been in care, including those who’ve been adopted, can also receive this offer.\r\n\r\nTo provide free early education for all 3 and 4-year-old children in England, the Government introduced the 15 hours universal free childcare scheme, which provides 570 hours per year free childcare from the term starting after a child’s 3rd birthday. Worth around £2,500 on average per year, it helps children to develop social skills and prepares them for school. \r\n\r\nThe 30 hours free childcare offer for 3 and 4-year-olds supports parents working at least 16 hours per week and earning at least the national minimum wage (this can be a sole parent in a single parent family; a lone parent only has to earn £125 per week – or the equivalent of 16 hours at the national minimum wage – to be able to access 30 hours of free childcare). 30 Hours provides an additional 570 hours per year above the universal 15 hours entitlement and is estimated to save families up to £5,000 per year in total.\r\n\r\nSharing the same eligibility criteria as 30 hours, Tax-Free Childcare (TFC), broadens access to childcare, enabling more parents to work.  Parents eligible, working 16 hours per week at the national minimum wage and earning under £100,000 per year, can receive up to £2,000 per year per child under 12 (or £4,000 per year per disabled child under 17). TFC is not available to those in receipt of Universal Credit, Tax Credits or Childcare Vouchers. \r\n\r\nSome employers offer the Childcare Voucher Scheme, which can save parents of under 16s (17s if disabled) and who are basic rate taxpayers up to £933 per parent per year in tax relief. Childcare Voucher Schemes are being replaced by TFC and will close to new entrants from 4 October 2018. Shared Parental Leave is another employment-related scheme, which allows parents to share up to 50 weeks’ leave and up to 37 weeks’ parental pay in the first year following their child’s birth or adoption. This is of particular value in supporting working mothers back into work.\r\n\r\nUC provides support with childcare for couples or single parents who are working but on a low income, and with a child under 16.

Published in July 2016, the Framework, which sets out the essential skills and knowledge needed for all staff working with people with a learning disability in health and social care settings, is structured in three tiers, or levels of training, to reflect the different levels of knowledge specific roles would require. \r\n\r\nTier one, which is relevant to the entire health and care workforce including ancillary staff, concerns general awareness skills and attitudes.  \r\n\r\nTier two is aimed at developing the knowledge and skills of staff that are likely to have regular contact with people with a learning disability. \r\n\r\nTier three is aimed at enhancing the knowledge, skills and attitudes of key staff and is relevant to those who are managing care and support services for people with a learning disability. \r\n\r\nEmployers and/or commissioners of education should use the Framework as guidance for the development and delivery of appropriate and consistent education and training, as well as for identifying the skills needed for particular roles in line with their legal responsibilities. By doing so, this will result in safer and more effective practice. \r\n\r\nTo ensure that health and care staff also have appropriate knowledge and awareness of autism, the Department of Health and Social Care has commissioned the development of a Core Skills and Competency Framework for Autism, which will be in line with the tiered approach adopted by other core skills frameworks. The development of this framework is expected to improve the availability of general awareness training to all staff across the health and care system and wider public services to equip them to offer appropriate support to autistic people (Tier 1), as well as developing and enhancing the knowledge, skills and attitudes for roles that have regular contact with autistic people (Tiers 2 and 3).\r\n\r\nThe recent annual report of the Learning Disability Mortality Review (LeDeR) Programme highlighted that people with a learning disability are still dying prematurely due to avoidable factors.

It would reward illegality, undermine the Immigration Rules for applying for leave to enter or remain, which Parliament has approved, and would be unfair to those migrants who come to the UK legally and observe immigration conditions. It could also encourage more migrants to attempt to enter or stay in the country illegally in the hope that they would be treated similarly. This additional risk of encouraging further illegal migration could potentially endanger individuals and their families by placing them in the hands of unscrupulous traffickers. \r\n\r\nImmigration Rules have been designed to be fair and to treat people with respect and dignity, but also firm with those who do not abide by the Rules, and that ensure people come to the UK for the right reasons – to work hard and contribute to our economy and society. \r\n\r\nIt is important that we distinguish between those who are here legally and those who are here illegally. We recognise the devastating consequences that illegal migration can have on individuals who become vulnerable to exploitation. We are committed to tackling the organised crime groups who profit from illegal migration and protecting those who are at risk of exploitation.   \r\nThere are routes available for individuals who believe they have a right to remain in the UK on the basis of family or private life, or other human rights grounds. Those who wish to can apply under the Immigration Rules and each application is considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the individual circumstances. \r\n\r\nIt is important that there are clear incentives to comply with the Immigration Rules. This means for example that private life established here while a person is in the UK unlawfully or while their immigration status is precarious should be accorded little weight. Full details can be found on GOV.UK by searching for Appendix FM 1.0b Family Life (as a Partner or Parent) and Private Life: 10-year Routes here: www.homeoffice.gov.uk.

In line with current NICE clinical guidance, women with uncomplicated pregnancies should usually be offered induction of labour between 41+0 and 42+0 weeks to avoid the risks of prolonged pregnancy. Decisions on induction of labour should also take into account women’s preferences and local circumstances.

The Secretary of State’s ambition is to halve the national rates of stillbirths, neonatal and maternal deaths and brain injuries occurring during or soon after birth by 2025, with a 20% reduction in these rates by 2020. A second ambition is to reduce the national pre-term birth rate from 8% to 6% by 2025.  \r\n\r\nNHS England’s Maternity Transformation Programme supports the Secretary of State’s ambitions, and recommends that all NHS Trusts with maternity services implement ‘Saving Babies’ Lives: A Care Bundle for Reducing Stillbirth’, published in March 2016. The Care Bundle guidance brings together four key elements of care based on the best available evidence and clinical practice, including reducing smoking in pregnancy; risk assessment and surveillance for fetal growth restriction; raising awareness of reduced fetal movement; and effective fetal monitoring during labour. During 2018/19, NHS trusts with maternity services have been asked to demonstrate compliance with all 4 elements of the ‘Saving Babies’ Lives’ care bundle as part of the Clinical Negligence for Trusts Scheme administered by NHS Resolution. Further information on this is available here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safer-maternity-care-progress-and-next-steps (see page 32 of Maternity Safety Strategy 2017).\r\n \r\nAn academic study by University of Manchester, evaluating the efficacy of the Care Bundle in 20 hospital sites will be published later in 2018.

We want to enable disabled people to have the same opportunities and choices as non-disabled people.

It is only right that support is targeted at those disabled people who require the most assistance to lead independent lives and PIP is achieving that; 29 per cent of the 1.6 million claimants now receiving PIP getting it at the highest level (£143.35 a week) compared to 15 per cent for working age Disability Living Allowance prior to the introduction of PIP.\r\n\r\nPIP is needs-based and not condition based and reviews are a key part of the benefit to ensure that the right support continues to be delivered. \r\n\r\nIn terms of award lengths and reviews, once someone has been awarded PIP, which can be paid at one of eight rates, that award will be reviewed. Reviews of PIP are a key part of the benefit and ensure that not only do awards remain correct where needs may change but that we also maintain contact with the claimant, both features missing from its predecessor Disability Living Allowance. Importantly, the length of an award is based on an individual’s circumstances and can vary from nine months to an on-going award, with a light touch review at the ten year point. \r\n\r\nHowever, PIP already recognises that for the most severely disabled claimants, the award review process could seem unnecessarily intrusive.

However, our 25 Year Environment Plan sets out measures to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste.","details":"There are no current plans to ban all non-recyclable packaging from 2022. However, the Government’s 25 Year Environment Plan sets out measures to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste. We will do this through a four-point plan that takes action at each stage of the product lifecycle – production, consumption and end of life. At the production stage, this includes encouraging producers to take more responsibility for the environmental impact of their products and making sure plastic items are more carefully designed. At the consumer stage we want to reduce demand for single-use plastic. At the end of life stage, we will make it easier for people to recycle and increase the amount of plastic being recycled. \r\n\r\nMore detail, including future targets and milestones, will be announced in the forthcoming Resources and Waste Strategy.  \r\nWe know that our producer responsibility waste management systems as they currently stand could be improved. That is why we have already committed in both our Clean Growth Strategy and our 25 Year Environment Plan to reforming the current systems to incentivise producers to take greater responsibility for the environmental impacts of their products, and to drive resource efficiency and increase the recycling of packaging waste.\r\n\r\nThe government has also confirmed that it will introduce a Deposit Return Scheme in England for single-use drinks containers, subject to consultation later this year. The consultation will look at the details of how such a scheme would work, alongside other measures to increase recycling rates.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the government has launched a call for evidence seeking views on how the tax system or charges could reduce the waste from single use plastics. The closing date is 18 May 2018 and it can be found at: www.gov.uk/government/consultations/tackling-the-plastic-problem.\r\n\r\nWorking through the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), the Government is developing and delivering activities in support of the use of recycled materials in new products and activities to stimulate its demand. In September 2016, WRAP and an industry advisory group published a framework for greater consistency in recycling. Actions from this framework aim to identify opportunities to rationalise packaging formats (in particular plastic packaging) to those that are recyclable and for which there is a steady market, and to help local authorities to recycle a greater variety of plastics.\r\nThe government is committed to increasing recycling rates. Current policies and regulations have resulted in a significant increase in recycling over the last decade, with recycling of packaging rising from around 57.5% in 2006 to 64.7% in 2016, but we recognise that more needs to be done. We will continue to work with businesses, local authorities and waste managers to encourage the use of recycled materials where possible in products and activities to stimulate demand.\r\n\r\nAlmost all packaging materials are in theory recyclable. However, in practice, not all may be recycled for a number of reasons: for example it may not be economically viable for a local council to collect and recycle some formats; local reprocessing infrastructure may be limited, and there may be a lack of end markets for some types of recycled materials.\r\nPackaging has an important and positive role to play in reducing product damage, food waste and consumer safety. Keeping food fresher for longer through innovations such as vacuum packing and re-sealable packs has a significant impact on extending the life of products and reducing waste. If a product is wasted due to insufficient packaging then its disposal often has a greater environmental impact than the packaging itself. \r\n\r\nRetailers and their suppliers are encouraged to use materials that are widely collected for recycling wherever possible. For example, The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations place a legal obligation on large UK businesses that make or use packaging to ensure that a proportion of the packaging they place on the market is recovered and recycled. This creates an incentive for companies to use less packaging and to ensure that their packaging can be recycled at end of life as it will reduce their costs in complying with the Regulations. We have also set rising targets for business up to 2020, which will continue to increase the amount of packaging waste recycled.\r\n\r\nBusinesses are also required to reduce waste arising in the first place by using appropriately sized packaging. The Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations require businesses to ensure that all packaging does not exceed what is needed to make sure that the products are safe, hygienic and acceptable for both the packed product and for the consumer. These Regulations apply to those responsible for the packing or filling of products into packaging and those importing packed or filled packaging into the UK from elsewhere.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","created_at":"2018-04-20T12:24:24.987Z","updated_at":"2018-05-22T14:24:18.123Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":215415,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/215415.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make anti-GD2 treatment available on the NHS","background":"Neuroblastoma is an aggressive cancer which mainly affects children under the age of 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnti GD2 therapy is standard in the US but is not available on the NHS.

Breast cancer can be a devastating disease and the Government is committed to providing well-managed screening programmes based on the most current peer reviewed evidence to ensure the greatest benefit.\r\n \r\nA screening programme is introduced following a robust process using peer reviewed evidence that shows the benefits to screen clearly outweigh harm and they are subject to central programme specifications and quality assurance. The English cancer screening programmes are internationally renowned for their rigour, standard of evidence, national implementation and quality assurance.\r\n \r\nThe NHS Breast Screening Programme (NHS BSP) in England offers all women between the ages of 50 and 70 the opportunity to be screened every 3 years for breast cancer, to help detect abnormalities and reduce the number of lives lost to invasive breast cancer.  The NHS BSP aims to detect breast cancer early when there is a greater chance of cure.  \r\n \r\nAlthough early detection is the best way to reduce breast cancer mortality by giving the opportunity to offer women more treatment options, which may save lives, there are also risks. These include over-diagnosis (referring for unnecessary tests) and over-treatment (operating on disease that is unlikely to cause serious harm).  For women under the age of 50, there is evidence that breast screening is less effective, as younger women have less fatty, denser breast tissue.  Screening with mammography (x-rays) is the technique that is evidence-based and can detect cancers at an early stage.  However, they are not very effective in diagnosing disease in younger women with dense breasts. Breast screening is offered from the age of 50 as the chance of developing the disease increases with age.  Four out of five breast cancers develop in women over the age of 50. There is insufficient evidence to confidently offer breast screening to women at a much younger age as doing so will find many abnormalities which will be treated but would never have developed into a cancer. This can cause harm and anxiety.  Not all breast cancers can be detected early when they are non-invasive and some women with non-invasive disease would never have cancer during their lifetime. \r\n \r\nThere are several trials in the Programme addressing these issues currently:\r\n•\tForget me not www.sloaneproject.co.uk/NonTreatmentStudy.htm  \r\n•\tLoris www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/find-a-clinical-trial/a-trial-comparing-surgery-with-active-monitoring-for-low-risk-dcis-loris\r\n•\t Sloane www.sloaneproject.co.uk/. \r\n \r\nThe 2012 UK independent review of breast cancer screening (Marmot review) estimated that inviting women between the ages of 50-70 reduces mortality from breast cancer in the population invited by 20% and saves an estimated 1,300 lives a year.  It also found that screening women outside the ages of 50 to 70 years could lead to over-diagnosis or over-treatment. The review can be found here: http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/prod_consump/groups/cr_common/@nre/@pol/documents/generalcontent/breast-screening-report.pdf \r\n \r\nIn June 2015, the World Health Organisation’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) published the findings of a review on breast cancer screening in the New England Journal of Medicine. A group of 29 independent international experts from 16 countries, convened by the IARC, assessed the cancer-preventive and adverse effects of various methods of screening for breast cancer. The findings of the review support the current age at which women are first invited for breast screening in England and the 3 year interval period between invitations. The IARC’s review found limited evidence for the effectiveness of screening women in the younger age group of 40 to 49. Women over 70 are not routinely invited for breast screening as there is no evidence to support this, although they can self-refer every 3 years if they wish. You review can be accessed here: www.iarc.fr/en/mediacentre/pr/2015/pdfs/pr234_E.pdf\r\n\r\nWomen that are identified as being at high risk of the disease (e.g. due to a genetic mutation such as BRCA1/2 or having had supradiaphragmatic radiotherapy at a young age) can be referred into the programme at a younger age. However, for this younger cohort, screening is usually performed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which is a more suitable screening test than mammography alone.\r\nWe encourage all women to be breast aware and anyone with concerns should discuss these with their GP.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care","created_at":"2018-05-15T11:21:33.481Z","updated_at":"2018-05-15T11:21:33.481Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":219512,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/219512.json"},"attributes":{"action":"The Government should end experiments on dogs.","background":"The evidence that using dogs in regulatory testing advances scientific knowledge or human safety is limited, yet it causes immense suffering to thousands of dogs every year.

Child sexual exploitation is not exclusive to any single culture, community, race or religion, and political or cultural sensitivities must not get in the way of preventing and uncovering it. \r\n\r\nThe Government is clear there should be an honest open debate on child sexual exploitation, including racial motivation.\r\n\r\nIn February 2017, the Government  published the ‘Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation: Progress Report’ and announced a £40 million package of measures to protect children and young people from sexual abuse and exploitation and crack down on offenders.  The ‘Progress Report’ details delivery of the ambitious programme of work set out in the 2015 ‘Tackling Child Sexual Exploitation’ report, and signals a step change in our national response to sexual exploitation and violence against children and young people. The full report can be found at: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/tackling-child-sexual-exploitation-progress-report. \r\n\r\nKey Actions include:\r\n  \r\n•\tWe have invested significantly in the law enforcement response to child sexual abuse, giving it the status of a national threat to empower police forces to apply their best skills and expertise to tackle the problem, and providing millions of pounds of investment through the Police Transformation Fund. This has led to a surge in police activity with an increasing number of cases prosecuted in the courts and heavy sentences handed down. We have invested in the frontline response to child sexual abuse, for example recruiting an extra 100 specialist rape and child sexual abuse prosecutors, establishing new investigative teams in the National Crime Agency, and launching a new Child Sexual Exploitation Response Unit to support social care, health and other agencies.  Our new £7.5 million Centre of Expertise on Child Sexual Abuse is conducting research into types of offending, so that we can understand and target them more effectively.\r\n\r\n•\tWe have funded a large scale communications campaign – Together, we can tackle child abuse – to raise awareness and encourage the public to report child abuse and neglect.

The Inquiry operates independently of Government and, within its terms of reference, decides for itself what it investigates and how.  It has already announced an investigation into institutional responses to the sexual exploitation of children by organised networks.

The views of the parents will be very important in the Court reaching decisions but it is the child’s best interests that are paramount, not the rights of those with parental responsibility.\r\n\r\nRegardless of any offer by hospitals based abroad to take a child to their hospital for treatment, clinicians and the courts are obliged to consider what is in the best interest of the individual child concerned, including in determining the viability of pursuing alternative diagnosis and treatment options. \r\nThe power to consent must be exercised according to the ‘welfare principle’: that the child’s ‘welfare’ or ‘best interests’ must be paramount. Even where a child lacks capacity to consent on their own behalf, it is good practice to involve the child as much as possible in the decision-making process. \r\n\r\nIf children have the capacity to give consent for themselves, consent should be sought directly from them. Once young people reach the age of 16, they are presumed in law to be competent to give consent for themselves for their own surgical, medical or dental treatment, and any associated procedures, such as investigations, anaesthesia or nursing care. Those under 16 are not automatically presumed to be legally competent to make decisions about their healthcare. Under-16s will be competent to give valid consent to a particular intervention if they have sufficient understanding and intelligence to enable him or her to understand fully what is proposed.   If a child is not competent to give consent for themselves, consent should be sought from a person with parental responsibility. \r\n\r\nAs is the case where patients are giving consent for themselves, those giving consent on behalf of child patients, must have the capacity to consent to the intervention in question, be acting voluntarily and be appropriately informed.

The issue was first debated in Parliament in 1875. The Slaughter of Animals Act 1933 introduced a legal requirement for stunning of animals prior to slaughter but contained an exemption where animals were slaughtered for consumption by Jewish and Muslim communities. Over the years the national rules governing religious slaughter have developed to provide additional protection to animals that are slaughtered in accordance with religious rites.\r\n\r\nEU Regulation 1099/2009, on the protection of animals at time of killing, requires all animals to be stunned before slaughter except where animals are slaughtered in accordance with religious rites. The EU Regulation and the Welfare of Animals at Time of Killing (England) Regulations 2015 (WATOK) include strict requirements on where, how and who can slaughter animals in accordance with religious rites. These requirements are monitored and enforced by Official Veterinarians of the Food Standards Agency to ensure that animals are spared unnecessary suffering, distress or pain during the slaughter process.\r\n\r\nThe legislation also requires each person either handling or carrying out slaughter operations, including religious slaughter, to hold a Certificate of Competence.

Poor service prior to this, as the Gibb report made clear, had largely been down to industrial action by the trade union on Southern rail. The Secretary of State and the Rail Minister have been clear that they share the frustration of passengers about the situation in recent weeks and they intervened as soon as the problems arose, with the Transport Secretary demanding a recovery plan. Since then, the Department has been in daily contact with the leadership of Network Rail and Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) and have insisted that both organisations put whatever resource is needed into resolving the situation, and into making sure that there is proper industry leadership of the recovery effort. Service information to passengers has improved and considerable work is being undertaken to operate the services in the timetable. \r\n \r\nThis timetable change was intended to deliver the benefits to passengers of major investment in the rail network. This means, through the £7 billion Thameslink Programme, new trains and improved stations, including the rebuilding of London Bridge and Blackfriars. The programme and timetable changes were designed to provide more frequent and longer trains through central London to respond to the huge growth in passenger numbers that we have seen in recent years. But this timetable change instead has resulted in unacceptable disruption for passengers that rely on these services.\r\n \r\nThe process of introducing the new timetable was overseen by an Industry Readiness Board, which included representatives from Network Rail, the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) and the train operating companies, and an Independent Assurance Panel. Both of these groups informed the Department that they had not been given any information to suggest that the implementation of the new timetable should be halted. These bodies were set up specifically to ensure that all parts of the rail network – Network Rail, GTR, other train operators - were ready to implement these major timetable changes. It should have been clear to them that some key parties were not ready; they did not raise this risk. As few as 3 weeks before the timetable was to be implemented GTR themselves assured the Transport Secretary they were ready to implement the changes. Clearly this was wrong, and it is totally unacceptable.\r\n \r\nInvestigations being carried out right now will give more information about what has gone wrong and why the industry remained of the view until the last moment that it would be able to deliver these changes.

Neither measure is expected to impact rent levels","details":"The Government introduced changes to finance cost relief as part of a package of measures at Summer Budget 2015 to help reduce the deficit and rebalance the economy. By restricting landlord’s finance cost relief to the basic rate of income tax we are helping to reduce the advantage landlords may have over homeowners in the property market. Income tax relief for finance costs is not available to ordinary homebuyers. It is also not available to those investing in other assets, such as shares, so we’re helping to reduce the distortion between property investment and investment in other assets.\r\n\r\nPreviously, landlords could get relief on their finance costs at their marginal rate of income tax. By restricting finance cost relief to the basic rate, all individual landlords will receive the same rate of income tax relief on their finance costs. \r\nLandlords can still claim income tax relief at their marginal rate of tax on day-to-day running costs incurred in letting out a property, such as letting agent fees and replacing furniture. Finance costs are different to other expenses as having a mortgage allows the landlord to purchase a more expensive property and incur larger gains on the investment than they would have done without it.\r\n\r\nUsing actual self-assessment data, HMRC estimate that only 1 in 5 landlords will pay more tax on their property income because of this measure. We appreciate that some of these landlords may face difficult decisions. This is why the government has chosen to act in a proportionate and gradual way. Basic rate income tax relief will still be available on all landlord's finance costs, and the government announced this change almost two years before its implementation. The restriction, introduced in April 2017, is being phased in over 4 years. This gives landlords time to adjust to the changes.\r\n\r\nGiven that only a small proportion of the housing market is affected by this change, the government does not expect it to have a large impact on either house prices or rent levels. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) also expect the impact on the housing market will be small.\r\n \r\nIn April 2016, the Government introduced higher rates of Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) for those purchasing additional properties. While it is right that people should be free to purchase a second home or invest in a buy-to-let property, the Government is aware that this can impact on other people’s ability to get on to the property ladder. The higher rates are part of the Government’s commitment to support first time buyers. Since the higher rates have been introduced, over 500,000 people have bought their first home, and first-time buyers make up an increased share of the mortgaged property market. \r\n\r\nAt Autumn Budget 2017, the Government announced further changes to permanently increase the price at which a property becomes liable to SDLT to £300,000 for first time buyers, with first-time buyers purchasing homes worth between £300,000 and £500,000 saving £5,000. This relief means that 80% of first-time buyers will not pay SDLT, and 95% of first time buyers who pay SDLT will benefit from the change. Since its introduction, 69,000 people have benefited from the relief. Over the next five years, this relief will help over a million first time buyers getting onto the housing ladder.\r\n\r\nThe Government has also taken wider action on housing to help renters get a fair deal and to address homelessness and rough sleeping. At Autumn Budget 2017, the Government committed to £2 billion of extra funding for affordable housing, including for social rented homes, bringing total investment in the Affordable Homes Programme to more than £9 billion.

Students are required to complete 2,300 hours of clinical learning so whilst they may be performing limited clinical duties, under close supervision, they are not being paid to staff hospitals.  \r\n\r\nThe Care Quality Commission (CQC) monitor the impact of nurse staffing on safety and quality of care.  CQC inspections will always include an assessment of the adequacy of nurse staffing levels, skill mix and competency and assess how decisions are reached on staffing levels and skill mix assuring that workforce plans are centred on the needs of patients and clinical safety.\r\n\r\nUnder the Department for Education student loan system students can claim up to a maximum maintenance loan of £11,354 a year, this loan is means tested and is dependent upon the location of study, the length of the course, income and residency.

A patient with a disability is not discriminated against should they require a transplant, they are assessed in the same way as any other potential recipient.\r\n\r\nAll patients undergo careful assessment before being placed onto the transplant waiting list. This assessment is divided into three main questions. First, whether a patient needs a transplant or whether another more effective treatment is available. Secondly the patient’s fitness is assessed to confirm whether they are well enough to receive a transplant. A transplant operation and the associated treatment that is required to make the transplant work is reasonably risky. Sometimes the patient needs extra procedures or medication before a transplant is even possible. Sadly, some people are just not fit enough to have this life saving or life enhancing operation. Thirdly there is an assessment of whether the patient is going to be able to care for themselves (and the transplant organ) after the transplant. This third stage is treated with particular care as the medical team will need to know whether the patient is able to look after their general health and take all the necessary medication in order to avoid rejection in the new transplant. \r\n\r\nWhen a patient with a learning disability is identified as being suitable for a transplant, the key factors are ensuring that consent for transplantation is in place and that they have the correct support during post-operative care. The process by which consent is obtained will vary depending on the patient’s age (adult or child) and where they live in the UK, as different legislation will apply. Regarding post-operative care, in most circumstances the recipient’s family or carers will be very keen and supportive in giving all care that is needed after the transplant operation. Alternatively, if the patient does not have a carer, social services can often provide the support a person with a disability might need after undergoing a medical procedure. \r\n\r\nDuring the period after a patient has received a transplant, there will be a number of medications that the patient will need  to take. This includes immunosuppressants – drugs which make it much less likely that the new transplanted organ will be rejected. If a transplant recipient decides to discontinue the required post-operative medication, rejection of the organ is very likely to follow, which is why it is important that a patient receives the support they need.\r\n\r\nThere are a range of duties and supporting tools to ensure health professionals are able to support people with a learning disability. \r\n\r\nAll public bodies, including NHS organisations, must be proactive in eliminating unlawful discrimination and advancing equal opportunities, under the Equality Act. Since 1st August 2016 onwards, all organisations that provide NHS care or adult social care have been legally required to follow the Accessible Information Standard. The Standard aims to make sure that people who have a disability, impairment or sensory loss are provided with information that they can easily read and understand and with support so they can communicate effectively with health and social care services.\r\n\r\nThe Government has mandated Health Education England (HEE) to provide national leadership on education, training and workforce development in the NHS in England. Through the Mandate we will ensure that the NHS workforce is “is available in sufficient numbers and possesses the right skills, values and behaviours to deliver care and support for people with learning disabilities, autism, mental health problems and multiple and complex needs”’\r\n\r\nHEE e-Learning for Health have a programme dedicated to disability and the subject is also addressed as part of other e-learning programmes, such as those on the Accessible Information Standard, the Adolescent Health Course, Safeguarding Adults and Safeguarding Children.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Health and Social Care funded the development of Disability Matters, which was launched in February 2015, an e-learning tool providing training in understanding and supporting the needs and rights of people with a disability, developed in partnership with people with a disability and their families. https://www.disabilitymatters.org.uk/ It is a free resource for professionals in the NHS, social care and other settings who might work with people with a disability.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care","created_at":"2018-03-20T10:01:14.076Z","updated_at":"2018-04-27T15:30:36.387Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":227134,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/227134.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Empower the UK Government or Parliament to regulate ferry prices.","background":"With current ferry prices being unregulated, companies are permitted to charge whatever they wish for crossings.

Arrangements are in place to ensure that prescriptions are affordable for everyone. Almost ninety per cent of prescription items are already free on the NHS in England and a number of prescription charge exemptions are in place, for which someone with a long-term condition like multiple sclerosis may qualify.  Exemptions principally cover those with certain medical conditions, pregnant women and new mothers, children under 16, students under the age of 19 and in qualifying full time education, anyone over 60, and those on a low income or on certain income related benefits.\r\n \r\nPeople on low incomes can apply for help with their health costs through the NHS Low Income Scheme. The Scheme provides income related help to people who are not automatically exempt from charges but who may be entitled to full or partial help if they have a low income and savings below a defined limit.\r\n\r\nAnyone who has to pay NHS prescription charges and needs prescriptions regularly or needs many prescription items can save money with a prescription prepayment certificate (PPC).  PPC holders pay no further charge at the point of dispensing and there is no limit to the number of items the holder may obtain through the certificate. There are two types of PPC – a three month PPC which costs £29.10 for three months and a twelve month PPC which costs £104 per year. A holder of a 12 month certificate can get all the prescriptions they need for just £2 per week. The quickest and easiest way to obtain a certificate is online. Importantly, this includes the option to spread the cost via direct debit over ten months for a twelve month certificate.\r\n \r\nAlthough extensive arrangements are in place to ensure people can access affordable prescriptions, we recognise that more could be done to promote them. The NHS Business Services Authority (NHS BSA) has already taken forward a project to promote PPCs among patients and is now proactively working with specific pharmacy chains to raise awareness. It has also worked with the Citizens Advice Bureau to encourage them to talk to clients about PPCs if appropriate. PPCs are publicised on the NHS BSA’s website and on NHS Choices and in 2016-17 the NHS BSA sent out over 1.6 million posters and leaflets to promote the scheme in GP surgeries and pharmacies.\r\n\r\nThe NHS BSA is exploring ways to help patients navigate the “help with health costs” landscape better so that they can get appropriate help with their health costs.  It is looking at the whole customer journey to identify areas where the process can be simplified and improved. This includes a move, where appropriate, to digitisation of the service. We are considering whether more can be done to support healthcare professionals with alerting patients to the help that might be available to them.\r\n\r\nThe NHS BSA has already developed an online tool to help patients to find out what help they may be able to get and where to apply for it. There have been over seventy five thousand users since it launched in September 2017 and the NHS BSA has received positive feedback on it. This checker has more recently been promoted on social media and has received national press coverage. \r\n\t\r\nThe current financial situation prevents the Government from making any significant changes to the prescription charging system.

It is a criminal offence for a person to belong to a proscribed organisation, invite support for a proscribed organisation, arrange a meeting in support of a proscribed organisation, or wear clothing or carry articles in public, which arouse reasonable suspicion that an individual is a member or supporter of a proscribed organisation. The penalties for proscription offences are a maximum of 10 years in prison and/or a fine.\r\n\r\nHizballah’s External Security Organisation (also known as the Military Wing) was proscribed by the UK Government in March 2001 and in 2008 the proscription was extended to Hizballah military apparatus including the Jihad Council.  Whilst the UK proscribes Hizballah’s military wing, we do not proscribe the group in its entirety. Proscription is an important, but not the only, part of the Government’s strategy to disrupt the activities of terrorist groups and those who provide support to them.  \r\n\r\nHizballah’s military wing is also designated in the UK under the Terrorist Asset-Freezing Act 2010. Therefore, funds or economic resources owned, held or controlled by Hizballah’s military wing in the UK can be frozen.  In July 2012, following the Burgas bombing, the EU also designated Hizballah’s military wing as a terrorist organisation under the EU asset freeze regime.\r\n\r\nThe current proscription and asset freeze already sends a clear message that we condemn Hizballah’s violence and support for terrorism. Groups are not free to spread hatred, fund terrorist activity or incite violence as they please, irrespective of whether they are included on the list of proscribed organisations or not.  \r\n\r\nThe flag for the organisation’s military wing is the same as the flag for its political wing. Therefore for it to be an offence for an individual to display the flags for this organisation the context and manner in which the flag is displayed must demonstrate that it is specifically in support of the proscribed elements of the group.\r\n\r\nPeaceful protest is a vital part of a democratic society and it is a long-standing tradition in this country that people are free to gather together and to demonstrate their views, however uncomfortable these may be to the majority of us, provided that they do so lawfully.  There is, of course, a balance to be struck.  Protesters’ rights need to be balanced with the rights of others to go about their business without fear of intimidation or serious disruption to the community.  Rights to peaceful protest do not extend to violent or threatening behaviour and the police have powers to deal with any such acts. The management of protests is of course a matter for the police.  Similarly, the investigation and prosecution of all criminal offences is a matter for the police, together with the Crown Prosecution Service.  \r\n\r\nThe UK Government condemns any language or act which attempts to delegitimise the State of Israel, and also hate crime of any kind, directed against any community, race or religion, which has absolutely no place in our society. Violence against anyone in this country is a crime and will be treated seriously. To reiterate, inciting hatred or racial abuse is still an offence regardless of whether an individual is a member of an organisation, even if that organisation is not proscribed in the UK.  \r\n\r\nThe Government acknowledges the request to extend the proscription of Hizballah to cover the group’s political wing, however, whilst the list of proscribed groups is kept under review, the Government does not routinely comment on whether an organisation is or is not under consideration for proscription.\r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2018-06-15T15:28:54.406Z","updated_at":"2018-06-15T15:28:54.406Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":220460,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/220460.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Ban combustible materials on residential tower blocks, schools and hospitals","background":"What happened at Grenfell Tower was a national disgrace.

As part of the consultation, we have asked for views on which buildings should be covered by a ban. The ban proposed in the consultation is focused on high-rise, residential buildings, and we will reflect on whether that is the right approach on the basis of the response to the consultation.\r\n\r\nResidents, industry and other interested parties will now be able to have their say on proposals affecting the safety of homes.

This includes a UK-EU free trade area for goods to ensure continued frictionless access at the border to each other's markets, underpinned by an upfront commitment to a common rulebook on goods and agri-food.\r\n\r\nWe have listened to EU leaders and we understand and respect the position that the four freedoms of the single market are indivisible and there can be no cherry-picking.\r\n\r\nThe Government’s proposals put our rights and responsibilities in a new balance that fulfils our joint ambition to establish a deep and special partnership once the UK has left the EU.\r\n\r\nThe White Paper also sets out a new proposal for a Facilitated Customs Arrangement (FCA) with the EU. The FCA is a business-friendly model that seeks to facilitate the greatest possible trade between the UK and its trading partners, whether in Europe or the rest of world, while allowing the UK to set its own tariffs. The FCA removes the need for new customs checks and controls between the UK and the EU, as if in a combined customs territory with the EU.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister has also been clear that in leaving the EU, we will also bring about an end to the jurisdiction of the CJEU in the UK.\r\n\r\nThe proposal set out in the White Paper delivers on that commitment. No longer will courts in the UK be able to refer cases to the CJEU, nor will the CJEU be able to arbitrate disputes between the UK and the EU.\r\n\r\nThe CJEU will no longer have the power to make laws for the UK and the principles of direct effect and of the supremacy of EU law will no longer apply in the UK. Instead, rights will be enforced in the UK by UK courts and in the EU by EU courts.\r\n\r\nThe UK will also leave the Common Agricultural Policy and Common Fisheries Policy. We will be able to design a domestic agricultural policy that works in the best interests of the UK. We will also be an independent coastal state under international law, and therefore be able to control and manage access to UK waters, including fisheries.\r\n\r\nAs the Prime Minister has said, our decision to leave the EU does not mark an end to our relationship with the EU. It marks a new beginning for our partnership with our European allies. However, the agreement we reach with the EU must respect the result of the referendum which was a vote to take control of our borders, laws and money.\r\n\r\nWe are confident that the we can reach a positive deal on our future partnership, as this would be to the mutual benefit of both the UK and the EU.

By 2022/23 annual spend will be £4bn.","details":"The Government recognises the invaluable contribution that unpaid and family carers make in our communities and is committed to doing more to support them. The support we need to provide extends far beyond financial support however. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) published a Carers Action Plan ‘Supporting carers today’ in June this year, setting out plans to support carers. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/carers-action-plan-2018-to-2020\r\n \r\nDWP is part of DHSC’s Employers Accreditation Pilot and is working with DHSC on the Carers Discovery project. \r\n \r\nFormal carers, i.e. those who are employed as “professional” carers, do of course need to receive all the protections that employment law offers, including receiving at least the National Living Wage/National Minimum Wage from their employers. \r\n \r\nInformal carers are those who provide care for family or friends. They do receive help through the benefit system, primarily through Carer’s Allowance (CA) (introduced in 1976) and for those on lower incomes, through means-tested benefits. \r\n \r\nThough society values a carers contribution highly, it has never been the role of the benefit system to pay people for the tasks that they choose to undertake in the way that an employer would. The purpose of CA is to provide a measure of financial support and recognition for people who give up the opportunity of full-time employment in order to provide regular and substantial care for a severely disabled person, but it is not and never was, designed to be a carer’s wage or intended to replace foregone earnings entirely. \r\n \r\nA carer may apply for CA if they provide care for 35 hours or more a week to a person on a qualifying disability benefits. The carer must be aged 16 years or over and not in full time education (defined as 21 hours or more a week). For those carers who can undertake some part-time work, there is an earnings limit in CA. CA can be received alongside part-time earnings of up to £120 net of certain expenses a week. Allowable expenses include income tax, National Insurance contributions and half of any contributions to an occupational or personal pension. Also, up to half the net earnings figure calculated can be allowed towards the cost of alternative care for the disabled person, or for a child aged under 16, while the carer is at work. These rules mean people can earn significantly more than the earnings limit and still get CA. Where possible, informal carers are encouraged to continue either working or studying part-time alongside their caring responsibilities in order to improve their own life chances and increase their social interaction. \r\n \r\nCA is funded from general taxation and is up-rated in line with the Consumer Price Index. Since 2010 the rate has increased from £53.90 to £64.60, meaning carers are £550 a year better off than they were in 2010. By 2022/23 we will be spending nearly £4 billion a year on CA. This is a clear indication of the Government’s commitment to carers.\r\n \r\nCarers on low incomes can also claim income-related benefits, such as Income Support and Pension Credit. These benefits can be paid to carers at a higher rate than those without caring responsibilities through the carer premium or equivalent additional amount, worth £36.00 a week. Universal Credit (UC) also includes a carer element worth £156.45 per monthly assessment period. Latest figures show that 6 out of ten households on UC with a Carer Entitlement recorded received a Monthly Award Amount of over £400: this is in addition to any CA they may receive. Receipt of means tested benefits can act as a “passport” to help with prescriptions and dental charges.\r\n \r\nFor carers not eligible for CA who are looking after sick or elderly family or friends, Carers Credit (CC) is a National Insurance Credit (not a benefit) which helps build qualifying years for State Pension purposes. To qualify for CC a person must be caring for one or more person for at least 20 hours a week, be over 16 years old but under State Pension age. The person being cared for must get either a qualifying benefit or be certified by a health or social care professional as needing the amount of care being provided. \r\n \r\nThe Government’s Fuller Working Lives Strategy sets out what the Government is doing to support carers who wish to remain in or return to work; as well as highlighting the sort of support that good employers should give carers in their workforce, such as flexible working. To spearhead some of this work the Government appointed the Business in the Community (BiTC) Age at Work leadership team as Business Champion for Older Workers. The Leadership Team spearhead the Government’s work to support employers to retain, retrain and recruit older workers. They actively promote the benefits of both employing and retaining older workers to employers across England – influencing them both strategically and in terms of practical advice. This work also benefits carers in the workplace.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions","created_at":"2018-08-21T15:58:33.305Z","updated_at":"2018-08-21T15:58:33.305Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":227209,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/227209.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Summon the Dutch ambassador to protest about the “Draw Muhammad” competition.","background":"For a Muslim, the respect and honour of Prophet Muhammad (Peace and Blessings be upon him) is above all else.\r\n \r\n\r\n","additional_details":"The drawing of any cartoon or image of the Blessed Prophet is deeply offensive.

","details":"We believe a high-quality music education should engage and inspire all pupils to develop a love of music, their talent as musicians, and increase their self-confidence, creativity and sense of achievement.\r\n\r\nOur National Plan for Music Education sets out our vision that all children have the opportunity to learn a musical instrument free of charge.\r\nBetween 2016-2020 we are spending £300 million on a network of music education hubs. The hubs ensure that every child aged 5-18 has the opportunity to learn a musical instrument; provide opportunities to play in ensembles; ensure that clear progression routes are available and affordable for all; and ensure that every pupil has the opportunity to sing regularly. In 2015/16, 662,871 pupils learned to play a musical instrument through whole class ensemble teaching that was provided or supported by music education hubs. Pupils and parents cannot be charged for this teaching. Data for 2016/17 will be published later this year.\r\n\r\nIn addition to music education hubs, we provide almost £120m through the Music and Dance Scheme to support exceptionally talented young musicians, dancers and choristers to attend specialist schools and centres of excellence. Also, the government has used almost £2m for National Youth Music Organisations (NYMOs) such as the National Youth Orchestra and £2m for ‘In Harmony’. ‘In Harmony’ aims to inspire and transform the lives of children in 6 areas in England through community-based orchestral music-making in areas of exceptional deprivation through high-quality musical education. Lastly, over £400,000 has gone to Music for Youth to provide opportunities for young people and families to perform in and attend regional and national festivals and concerts, who might not otherwise have had access. \r\n\r\nThere are also great innovations being carried out by organisations such as ABRSM, which, together with the DfE, Classic FM and Decca, launched the Classical 100 music app with recordings of the 100 pieces of classical music primary school pupils should hear.

The Government has a statutory requirement to report annually to Parliament on its progress in delivering against the Covenant.","details":"The Armed Forces Covenant (“the Covenant”) is a promise by the nation that the Armed Forces community (serving personnel, veterans, and their families) should not be disadvantaged in accessing public and private goods and services as a result of their service and that special provision should be made for those who have sacrificed the most, including the injured and the bereaved.\r\n\r\nEnshrined in the 2011 Armed Forces Act, the Covenant applies across the UK. The Government (HMG) has a statutory requirement to report annually to Parliament on its progress in upholding the Covenant. These reports include a growing list of objective performance measures and the independent observations of the Service charities and the Families Federations to hold HMG to account.\r\n\r\nSince 2011 much has been achieved and more remains to be done.  The Covenant is embedded in the NHS constitution and awareness in healthcare professionals of issues faced by the Armed Forces community is improving -  the Covenant now forms part of the Royal College of GPs’ membership exam.  Access to specialist prosthetics treatments and to mental healthcare services has improved significantly, following the launch of the Transition, Intervention and Liaison Services, and Complex Treatment Service. In England, the Service Pupil Premium has provided funding to mitigate the impact of Service life on children’s education and from September, more detail will be available to teachers via the Common Transfer File on Service children’s educational needs and family circumstances.  Young Service families are being helped onto the property ladder with the Forces Help to Buy scheme which has awarded £215 million (circa £15,000 per claim) to around 14,300 successful applicants since April 2014.  While there is a great deal of support available, those who need it are not always aware of how to access it. The Covenant-funded Veterans Gateway looks to address this by providing a single point of contact and signposting veterans to the most appropriate source of support; to date 8,486 veterans have contacted the service.\r\n\r\nAll 407 Local Authorities (LAs) in GB have signed the Covenant, with bespoke arrangements in Northern Ireland. Guidance is available to LAs on how they can most effectively support their Service populations; including using the £10 million per annum Covenant Fund to build local partnerships between the Armed Forces and the wider community.\r\n  \r\nThe partnership theme is also resonating in the private sector where support for the Covenant is growing rapidly, with more than 2,500 signatories. Companies are pledging support to veterans, reservists and military spouses by offering flexible HR policies and acknowledging the skills learnt during time in the Services. Further success has been achieved commercially, with companies agreeing to waive cancellation fees on media packages for those posted at short notice and mortgage providers exempting Service personnel from higher rate buy-to-let mortgage products.\r\n\r\nWhen there is a need to legislate, then we will do so, for example the Armed Forces (Flexible Working) Act 2018 reflects the demands of modern family life by providing more flexible working opportunities, in acknowledgement of the desire of Service personnel to have more control over their careers and how they live. Another example is HMG’s new statutory requirement, due to come into effect this autumn, to refer Service leavers at risk of homelessness to the relevant LA. Targeting specific issues in this way is the most effective means of mitigating disadvantage.\r\n\r\nHMG’s commitment to the Covenant was reinforced in 2017 with the creation of the Ministerial Covenant and Veterans Board, strengthening delivery of the Covenant across government. Every Department on the Board has appointed a lead Minister for Covenant issues. The Board is also overseeing a veterans’ strategy which will review current provision for veterans across the UK and make its recommendations before the end of the year. As part of this work, the MOD is also developing a new transition policy to provide more comprehensive support to Service families as they transition to civilian life, including advice and support on housing matters.\r\n\r\nIt is HMG’s view that much of what the Covenant has achieved so far stems from its voluntary nature.  It is a pact between the Armed Forces community and the nation in acknowledgment of the sacrifices they have made.  The nation honours this pact because it is the right thing to do, not because they are obliged to do so.  \r\n\r\nUseful links:\r\nForces Help to Buy statistics\r\nhttps://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/701878/FHTB_Official_Statistics_Q4_201718.pdf\r\nVeterans Gateway\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/veterans-gateway\r\n\r\nGuidance for local authorities\r\nhttps://www.armedforcescovenant.gov.uk/localauthorities/\r\n\r\nMinistry of Defence","created_at":"2018-05-31T12:39:19.662Z","updated_at":"2018-06-01T13:34:49.113Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":225899,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/225899.json"},"attributes":{"action":"For all Suicides by Veterans to be recorded as Veterans by all UK Coroners","background":"At the moment Coroners in the UK do not have to keep records of suicides by Veterans even though several Coroners back the calls for such data to be kept in a readily accessible format therefore we don't know if the rates given within studies are higher or lower than civialian suicides.","additional_details":"There is evidence that a disturbing number of Veterans from the most recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan are taking or attempting to take their own lives.","state":"open","signature_count":13624,"created_at":"2018-07-25T15:02:02.552Z","updated_at":"2018-09-04T23:38:54.658Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-07-31T14:47:59.485Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-07-25T15:24:48.018Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2018-08-18T00:41:31.654Z","government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Kate England","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":225025,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/225025.json"},"attributes":{"action":"The UK government should ban Steve Bannon from entering the UK","background":"Steve Bannon is a far-right political figure who poses a direct risk to the security of the UK.

In response to the recent increases in knife crime, gun crime and homicide, the Government published the Serious Violence Strategy.  The Strategy outlines an ambitious programme working with a range of Government Departments and partnerships across a number of sectors such as education, health, social services, housing, youth services, and victim services.  \r\n\r\nThe strategy makes clear that our approach is not solely focused on law enforcement, very important as that is, but depends also on partnerships across a number of sectors.  In particular, it needs the support of communities thinking about what they can do themselves to help prevent violent crime happening in the first place and how they can support measures to get young people and young adults involved in positive activities.  \r\n\r\nWe know intervening early can help us catch young people before they go down the wrong path, encouraging them to make positive choices and that is why the strategy represents a step change in the way we think and respond and in particular, a shift to early intervention and prevention steering young people away from crime in the first place and put in place measures to tackle the root causes of the problem.\r\n \r\nAction in the strategy is centred on the following key themes:\r\n\r\n•\tTackling county lines and misuse of drugs; \r\n•\tEarly intervention and prevention;\r\n•\tSupporting communities and local partnerships; and\r\n•\tLaw enforcement and the criminal justice response\r\n\r\nThe strategy sets out a range of key actions we will take to tackle serious violence, building on the significant programmes of work already in place to tackle knife crime, gun crime and the acid attacks action plan.

This Act sets out the process by which trans people can legally change their gender. We will publish this consultation in due course. All members of the public will be able to respond to the consultation. Once the consultation has closed and the Government has carefully considered the responses, only then will we decide how to reform the GRA. \r\n\r\nGender recognition is a devolved issue and the Scottish Government ran a separate consultation, which closed on 1 March 2018.\r\n \r\nWe have been clear since announcing our intention to consult on the GRA that we will ask about how we can make the process of applying for a Gender Recognition Certificate less bureaucratic and intrusive for trans people. That does not necessarily mean we are proposing self-declaration of gender. The Government will consider the results of the consultation carefully before making any decision on how to reform the GRA. We are clear that we have no intention of amending the Equality Act 2010, the legislation that allows for single sex spaces. Any GRA reform will not change the protected characteristics in the Equality Act nor the exceptions under the Equality Act that allow provision for single and separate sex spaces.\r\n\r\nThe Government does not intend to change the safeguarding processes that are currently used in refuges and healthcare services. Providers of women-only services can continue to provide services in a different way, or even not provide services to trans individuals, provided it is objectively justified on a case-by-case basis. The same can be said about toilets, changing rooms or single sex activities. Providers may exclude trans people from facilities of the sex they identify with, provided it is a proportionate means of meeting a legitimate aim. \r\n\r\nWe are committed to a respectful and evidence-based discussion, and, for this reason, we have engaged in many pre-consultation meetings with a range of stakeholders including women’s groups, charities and service providers. We will continue to do so during the consultation. The consultation offers an opportunity for women from all backgrounds to be heard.\r\n \r\nAs part of our evidence gathering, we are looking at the experiences of other countries who have different gender recognition models. There are countries, such as Ireland, Malta, and Belgium that have adopted a self-declaration model, making use of statutory declarations. We are also looking at countries that do not have a full self-declaration model, such as the Netherlands. \r\n\r\nWe want to emphasise that any reform of the GRA will not mean reform to the medical treatment that trans people receive, and the age at which they can receive this. Access to treatment on the NHS, including cross-sex hormones (which the NHS allows from 16) and surgery (which the NHS allows from 18), is not regulated by the GRA, but decided on by clinicians. Any GRA reform will not change this.\r\n\r\nWhen the GRA was introduced, it was considered a world-leading piece of legislation. Whilst it has worked well in many ways, over the last decade it has been viewed as outdated. We have heard from many trans people that the current requirements feel overly intrusive and bureaucratic. It includes the need to provide a diagnosis of gender dysphoria and a second medical report of any treatment, proof of having lived for at least two years in their acquired gender, the approval of their spouse if married, as well as the fee to apply, and any associated costs with obtaining supporting evidence. Furthermore, trans people are already able to more easily change their name and gender in their passport and driving license. Streamlining the process of changing their legal gender on their birth certificate, so that they are recognised legally in their acquired gender, would help trans people to have all their identity documents match. \r\n\r\nThe process of gaining a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC), as set out in the Gender Recognition Act, is a Government service that is not working well for the people it is designed for. Only 4,850 GRCs have been issued since the Act came into force. Our research shows that trans people find the process too bureaucratic and hard to use. We therefore propose improving this service, but want to ensure we only do so after a full consultation, to allow us to hear from trans people, and also from women’s groups, faith groups, LGBT groups, young people’s organisations, charities, refuges, and many more individuals and organisations, so that we can decide how best to make these reforms.\r\n\r\nThe Government is committed to improving the position of women and girls, and supports their rights, safety, privacy and dignity. We are also committed to improving the position of trans people and supporting their rights. We are confident that advancing the rights of trans people does not have to compromise women’s rights, and will work with all groups to ensure this.\r\n\r\nGovernment Equalities Office","created_at":"2018-06-05T09:27:51.923Z","updated_at":"2018-06-05T09:27:51.923Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":220172,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/220172.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Keep the rights of EU27 + EFTA citizens already in the UK unchanged after Brexit","background":"Before the EU referendum Vote Leave said: “There will be no change for EU citizens already lawfully resident in the UK.
