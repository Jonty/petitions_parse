The Prime Minister has called modern slavery one of the ‘greatest human rights issues of our time’, and made clear that the international community must step up our efforts to eradicate it.  It is not acceptable that such exploitation is occurring in the 21st Century. \r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister launched a Call to Action to end modern slavery at this year’s UN General Assembly alongside 40 other countries, and committed to doubling UK aid spend in support of this objective to £150 million. We will continue to push for an increased international response, through the UN and other channels, to eliminate these horrific crimes, provide support for victims, and bring criminals to justice. In particular, we are pushing for the United Nations Security Council to take greater steps to combat slavery in conflict situations. \r\n\r\nThe UK Government shares others’ disgust and grave concern at the recent video footage apparently showing slave markets in Libya.  We welcome the Libyan government’s commitment immediately to investigate these reports and to ensure that those involved are brought to justice.   In addition, the UK has raised with the Libyan Prime Minister the importance of offering humanitarian support to migrants.  \r\n\r\nWe have consistently argued for a comprehensive approach, addressing the root causes of migration as well as their consequences.  In addition to the UK’s £150 million commitment on modern slavery, UK programmes have provided humanitarian aid to migrants and refugees, and delivered assistance in detention centres and to those rescued at sea.  We have provided specific support to women and girls, to protect them from the heightened risks of trafficking and sexual and gender based violence.  So far this year, the Department for International Development has supported more than 20,000 emergency interventions such as healthcare, funding psychosocial support, hygiene kits and safe shelter to migrants and refugees in Libya.\r\n\r\nWe have also developed a new £75m migration programme, which will specifically target migrants travelling from West Africa via the Sahel to Libya.  It will provide critical humanitarian assistance and protection and assist those along the way that may wish to return home, providing information about the dangers ahead and offering vulnerable people meaningful alternatives to the treacherous journeys to Libya and Europe.  \r\n\r\nAt the United Nations General Assembly in September, the Prime Minister committed to increasing efforts to tackle smuggling and trafficking through building the capacity of Libyan law enforcement agencies, and supporting efforts to sanction people smugglers at the UN.  \r\n\r\nThe UK has made clear at the United Nations Security Council our condemnation of these reports, and we support the recent Declaration from the EU-Africa Summit and the establishment of an EU-AU-UN Taskforce to address this dire situation to help returns.  UK programming has enabled the assisted voluntary return of over 1,400 migrants from Libya to their home countries this year, and we support further efforts in this area, including by the European Union Emergency Trust Fund for Africa.\r\n\r\nWe are clear that a sustainable improvement in the human rights situation in Libya can only be achieved under the stability of a strong and united Government, and we are actively supporting UN-led efforts to deliver a more inclusive political settlement in Libya.  As well as our support for peace mediation and stability we are providing support to improve women’s rights, civil society, municipalities, and freedom of speech.  A safe, secure and prosperous Libya that is able confidently to tackle the challenges in the region is in all our interests.\r\n\r\nThe Government looks forward to responding with fuller details on this very important issue in the forthcoming Westminster Hall Debate on Monday 18 December.\r\n\r\nForeign and Commonwealth Office","created_at":"2017-12-13T10:52:14.144Z","updated_at":"2017-12-13T10:52:14.144Z"},"debate":{"debated_on":"2017-12-18","transcript_url":"https://hansard.parliament.uk/commons/2017-12-18/debates/D4D9004C-0D4E-4DAD-8C98-309E2C42D2E1/EnslavementOfBlackAfricans(Libya)","video_url":"http://parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/71772c45-c2ba-400a-a9f3-7bcdd9400907","debate_pack_url":"http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/CDP-2017-0259","overview":""}}},{"type":"petition","id":205106,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/205106.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Stop the privatisation of NHS services","background":"We call for a ban on the outsourcing (privatisation) of NHS services, and stop the renewal of any outsourcing contracts already signed.

Therefore the Government considers that a public inquiry into this tragic case is not necessary.","details":"The murder of Jamie Bulger was an appalling crime which shocked the nation and, 25 years on, continues to be of huge interest and concern. Our deepest sympathies remain with Mrs Fergus and Mr Bulger for the pain and suffering they have endured. \r\n\r\nBecause this case has been of such understandable concern, when the man formerly known as Jon Venables was recalled to custody in February 2010, the then Justice Secretary asked Sir David Omand, the former Permanent Secretary at the Home Office, to conduct an extensive review of the management of Venables from the time of his release from Red Bank Secure Children’s Home in 2001 until his recall to custody. In July 2010 Venables was convicted of possessing, downloading and sharing indecent images of children, and Sir David’s detailed report was published in November 2010 and can be found at the following link: https://www.justice.gov.uk/downloads/publications/corporate-reports/MoJ/2010/omand-review-web.pdf \r\n\r\nThe independent Parole Board directed Venables’ re-release on life licence – subject to strict licence conditions in July 2013 after a thorough risk assessment and in accordance with the statutory release test, which is whether it is necessary on the grounds of public protection for the offender to be detained in custody. The Parole Board is legally not allowed to share the reasons behind any of its release decisions, but the Government last month announced an urgent review into how to increase the transparency of Parole-Board decision-making and whether and how it might be possible to challenge those decisions.\r\n\r\nUnlike in 2010, Jon Venables’ recent criminal acts were discovered as a direct result of the tight monitoring to which he was subject by the Police and Probation Services. He has also constantly been subject to stricter licence conditions and more scrutiny than most lifers would be at the same stage of their sentence. For that reason, a review of the management of Venables since 2010 would not have the same clear focus. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, the Government’s number one priority is public safety so we will of course keep the monitoring practice under constant review. Venables is now serving a sentence of 40 months’ imprisonment for possessing indecent images of children. Once he has completed the custodial part of that sentence, he will remain in custody until the independent Parole Board determines that his risk is such that he may be re-released on life licence.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Justice","created_at":"2018-02-14T14:06:36.907Z","updated_at":"2018-02-14T14:06:36.907Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":216539,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/216539.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Amnesty for anyone who was a minor that arrived In Britain between 1948 to 1971","background":"Windrush Generation were invited as settlers and as British subjects.

Section 7 of the Inquiries Act 2005 allows the Minister responsible for an inquiry to appoint further panel members during the course of an inquiry with the agreement of the Chair.\r\n\r\nIn October 2017, the Chair announced the appointment of 7 expert witnesses with backgrounds in fire safety, forensic fire analysis, fire engineering, disaster resilience and also anatomy and human identification. The expert witnesses will provide a range of technical advice and expert reports to assist the work of the Inquiry in delivering its terms of reference.\r\n\r\nIn addition, in November 2017, the Chair announced the appointment of 3 assessors with backgrounds in community engagement and social housing, local authority administration and structural engineering.  The Chair also confirmed at the Inquiry’s preliminary hearing in September that he would expect the assessors to see all the evidence and sit with him when taking oral evidence. The Chair has also confirmed that he may make further appointments if needed.\r\nFollowing the announcement of these appointments, the Prime Minister carefully considered the composition of the Inquiry panel in light of the diversity and expertise of advice now available to the Inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister wrote to the representatives of the survivors and bereaved families on 21 December 2017 and informed them of her decision not to appoint additional panel members. The Prime Minister’s decision was similarly communicated to the Inquiry on the same date.\r\n\r\nHaving regard to the terms of reference and the assistance to be provided by the assessors, and the expert witnesses, it is the Prime Minister’s view that the Inquiry panel has the necessary expertise to undertake the Inquiry as it is currently constituted. The Prime Minister is also conscious of the need for the Inquiry to complete its initial report as quickly as reasonably possible. The Prime Minister therefore considers that additional panel members should not be appointed at this stage.\r\n\r\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Prime Minister fully took into account her duty under section 149 of the Equality Act 2010 (the Public Sector Equality Duty – PSED).\r\n\r\nThe Government recognises the importance of ensuring that those most affected by the tragedy are able to contribute fully to the Inquiry and that is why the Prime Minister welcomes the consideration being given by Sir Martin Moore-Bick to the establishment of a community advisory panel, as proposed at the December procedural hearing.\r\n\r\nSuch a panel, similar to that which has worked well for the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, could play a very beneficial role in putting those most affected at the heart of the Inquiry and enabling them to ensure that their views and experiences are heard. It is for Sir Martin, as Chair of the independent Inquiry, to take this forward, in consultation with the Grenfell Tower community, and the Government hopes that he will be able to do this as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nIn line with the Inquiry Rules 2006, legal representatives of the Grenfell community core participants will receive in advance of hearings disclosure of relevant evidence; will be able to make opening and closing statements at certain hearings and can suggest lines of questioning to be pursued by Counsel to the Inquiry.

It is important to note that while in some venues the cost of providing the service exceeds the income received in sales, other venues in the Commons make a profit which contributes to reducing overall costs. As shown in their transparency publication\r\n( https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/foi/transparency-publications/hoc-transparency-publications/catering-services/transparency-reporting-catering-services/) these costs have fallen considerably over the last two Parliaments and have halved since 2010.\r\n\r\nCustomers of the House of Commons Catering Services include some of the 650 MPs but also around 14,500 other pass-holders, many of whom are staff on lower wages that work irregular hours.

","details":"The UK welcomes genuine visitors to the UK. The visitor route offers a huge range of activities that can be undertaken whilst a person is in the UK, including spending time with family. \r\n\r\nEvery visitor is assessed against the same Immigration Rules regardless of nationality. The only difference is where that assessment is made. Some individuals are assessed overseas by an entry clearance officer, while others are assessed at the UK border. All visitors to the UK are assessed against the Immigration Rules on a case by case basis.\r\n\r\nNationals of some non-EEA countries need a visa to visit the UK. Visas are an important part of securing the UK’s border and are an effective tool for the UK in reducing illegal immigration, tackling organised crime and protecting national security. \r\n\r\nAppendix V to the Immigration Rules sets out the requirements that a person seeking entry to the UK as a visitor must meet. This includes that a visitor must satisfy the decision maker that they are a genuine visitor who intends to leave the UK at the end of their visit and will not live in the UK for extended periods through frequent or successive visits, or make the UK their own home. They must be able to show that they are able to accommodate, support and maintain themselves during their visit without working or accessing public funds. There is flexibility in the rules for visitors to be maintained and accommodated by friends or relatives. \r\n\r\nAutomatically approving visas for a select group of people would mean that important considerations against the Immigration Rules would not be applied consistently and could raise equality concerns. It could lead to discrimination against those who do not have family members in the UK but have just as valid a reason for wishing to visit the UK.\r\n\r\nThere is also a danger of additional complexity in the assessment process around how an individual would prove that they are the family member of a British citizen. There could be unintended consequences that make the application process longer, more difficult and costly.\r\n\r\nThe Government recognises the importance of family ties. In 2015 we simplified the immigration system for people visiting the UK by consolidating the number of visitor routes from fifteen to four and providing shortened, user-friendly Immigration Rules and guidance to make the requirements easier to understand. The changes created an easier-to-use, streamlined system with more flexibility for those visiting the UK over what they can do when they are in the UK. \r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2018-01-22T16:46:53.272Z","updated_at":"2018-01-22T16:46:53.272Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":204098,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/204098.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Stop the Common Fisheries Policy being adopted into UK law post-Brexit.","background":"We call on the Government to make the fishing industry a stand-alone entity, outside of the 'Great Repeal Bill,' after revelations that 'technical measures' of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) will be adopted into UK law on our leaving the EU.","additional_details":"On the UK's withdrawal from the EU, Britain can leave the CFP and reclaim its 200-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) under international law (UNCLOS).\r\n\r\nAdopting UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) would allow total UK control over access; the setting of quota; fisheries management, and fishing systems; rather than blindly following the terms dictated to us by Brussels. \r\n\r\nHowever, adopting the CFP into UK law for transitional purposes not only allows continued access for EU vessels into UK waters but also opens the possibility for the EU taking legal action, claiming, 'continuity of rights.'\r\n\r\nTherefore, if we are to have a fishing industry post-Brexit, keeping the terms of the CFP in place is not an option!","state":"open","signature_count":62562,"created_at":"2017-10-31T13:10:26.433Z","updated_at":"2018-04-21T23:26:59.588Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-11-03T17:05:35.694Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-10-31T13:35:18.798Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2017-11-08T23:42:31.271Z","government_response_at":"2017-11-21T12:29:41.820Z","debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Michael Hookem MEP","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"When the UK leaves the EU, we will no longer be bound by the Common Fisheries Policy.","details":"As an independent Coastal State, we will regain our rights to manage our fisheries in accordance with our rights under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and have control of our Exclusive Economic Zone (out to 200 nautical miles or the median line with other states).

We are committed to reducing the rates of stillbirth in England and improving maternity outcomes for women and babies. \r\n\r\nThe decision to induce pregnancy is one that must be taken following careful consideration between the woman and her obstetrician. In line with current NICE clinical guidance, women with uncomplicated pregnancies should usually be offered induction of labour between 41+0 and 42+0 weeks to avoid the risks of prolonged pregnancy. Decisions on induction of labour should also take into account women’s preferences and local circumstances.

The Secretary of State’s ambition is to halve the national rates of stillbirths, neonatal and maternal deaths and brain injuries occurring during or soon after birth by 2025, with a 20% reduction in these rates by 2020. A second ambition is to reduce the national pre-term birth rate from 8% to 6% by 2025.  \r\n\r\nNHS England’s Maternity Transformation Programme supports the Secretary of State’s ambitions, and recommends that all NHS Trusts with maternity services implement ‘Saving Babies’ Lives: A Care Bundle for Reducing Stillbirth’, published in March 2016. The Care Bundle guidance brings together four key elements of care based on the best available evidence and clinical practice, including reducing smoking in pregnancy; risk assessment and surveillance for fetal growth restriction; raising awareness of reduced fetal movement; and effective fetal monitoring during labour. During 2018/19, NHS trusts with maternity services have been asked to demonstrate compliance with all 4 elements of the ‘Saving Babies’ Lives’ care bundle as part of the Clinical Negligence for Trusts Scheme administered by NHS Resolution. Further information on this is available here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/safer-maternity-care-progress-and-next-steps (see page 32 of Maternity Safety Strategy 2017).\r\n \r\nAn academic study by University of Manchester, evaluating the efficacy of the Care Bundle in 20 hospital sites will be published later in 2018. Following this, the Care Bundle guidance will be updated to reflect new evidence and best practice. \r\n \r\nOverall NHS England is making good progress in reducing the number of stillbirth. It is on track to deliver the 20% reduction by 2020 and has already seen a 16% reduction since 2010. \r\n\r\nDepartment of Health and Social Care","created_at":"2018-04-17T15:17:13.733Z","updated_at":"2018-04-17T15:17:13.733Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":208170,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/208170.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Manufacture the new blue passport in GB not Germany or France.","background":"The new blue passports have been hailed as a sign Britain is seizing back control from the EU - but they could end up being made in France or Germany.\r\nWhen the uk should be manufacturing these with the uk company De La Rue who produces this \u0026 many other documents, secure British jobs not eu.","additional_details":"The government has released the information into the news that they could give a French or German company £490 million.\r\nSo the £490,000,000 will not be supporting British jobs or support people paying British tax, this will take money out of our country.\r\nPlease sign and share.","state":"open","signature_count":35170,"created_at":"2017-12-22T12:58:35.784Z","updated_at":"2018-04-21T23:49:41.914Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-03-02T14:04:08.286Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-12-22T13:54:08.991Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2018-03-23T15:39:40.073Z","government_response_at":null,"debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Lee fillingham","rejection":null,"government_response":null,"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":203615,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/203615.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Create a Freedom of Speech Act and Bring an End to \"Hate Speech\" laws","background":"For several years now the government has been infringing peoples' most basic rights to speak freely on matters, by deeming their speech \"offensive\" or \"hateful\" and declaring that such speech, even online, warrants being fined or jailed.

Trap evaluation is currently carried out by the Animal and Plant Health Agency, which then recommends whether a trap should be approved or not and, if so, what conditions of use (placement criteria, permitted target species) should apply. \r\n\r\nUnder the Spring Traps Approval (Variation) (England) Order 2015, the Goodnature A24 Rat and Stoat Trap may only be used for the purpose of killing rats and stoats.

Our 25 Year Environment Plan sets out measures to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste.","details":"The Government’s 25 Year Environment Plan sets out measures to eliminate all avoidable plastic waste. We will do this through a four-point plan that takes action at each stage of the product lifecycle – production, consumption and end of life. At the production stage, this includes encouraging producers to take more responsibility for the environmental impact of their products and making sure plastic items are more carefully designed. At the consumer stage we want to reduce demand for single-use plastic. At the end of life stage, we will make it easier for people to recycle and increase the amount of plastic being recycled. \r\n\r\nMore detail, including future targets and milestones, will be announced in the forthcoming Resources and Waste Strategy.  \r\nWe know that our producer responsibility waste management systems as they currently stand could be improved. That is why we have already committed in both our Clean Growth Strategy and our 25 Year Environment Plan to reforming the current systems to incentivise producers to take greater responsibility for the environmental impacts of their products, and to drive resource efficiency and increase the recycling of packaging waste.\r\n\r\nThe government has also confirmed that it will introduce a Deposit Return Scheme in England for single-use drinks containers, subject to consultation later this year. The consultation will look at the details of how such a scheme would work, alongside other measures to increase recycling rates.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the government has launched a call for evidence seeking views on how the tax system or charges could reduce the waste from single use plastics. The closing date is 18 May 2018 and it can be found at: www.gov.uk/government/consultations/tackling-the-plastic-problem.\r\n\r\nWorking through the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP), the Government is developing and delivering activities in support of the use of recycled materials in new products and activities to stimulate its demand. In September 2016, WRAP and an industry advisory group published a framework for greater consistency in recycling. Actions from this framework aim to identify opportunities to rationalise packaging formats (in particular plastic packaging) to those that are recyclable and for which there is a steady market, and to help local authorities to recycle a greater variety of plastics.\r\nThe government is committed to increasing recycling rates. Current policies and regulations have resulted in a significant increase in recycling over the last decade, with recycling of packaging rising from around 57.5% in 2006 to 64.7% in 2016, but we recognise that more needs to be done. We will continue to work with businesses, local authorities and waste managers to encourage the use of recycled materials where possible in products and activities to stimulate demand.\r\n\r\nAlmost all packaging materials are in theory recyclable. However, in practice, not all may be recycled for a number of reasons: for example it may not be economically viable for a local council to collect and recycle some formats; local reprocessing infrastructure may be limited, and there may be a lack of end markets for some types of recycled materials.\r\nPackaging has an important and positive role to play in reducing product damage, food waste and consumer safety. Keeping food fresher for longer through innovations such as vacuum packing and re-sealable packs has a significant impact on extending the life of products and reducing waste. If a product is wasted due to insufficient packaging then its disposal often has a greater environmental impact than the packaging itself. \r\n\r\nRetailers and their suppliers are encouraged to use materials that are widely collected for recycling wherever possible. For example, The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations place a legal obligation on large UK businesses that make or use packaging to ensure that a proportion of the packaging they place on the market is recovered and recycled. This creates an incentive for companies to use less packaging and to ensure that their packaging can be recycled at end of life as it will reduce their costs in complying with the Regulations. We have also set rising targets for business up to 2020, which will continue to increase the amount of packaging waste recycled.\r\n\r\nBusinesses are also required to reduce waste arising in the first place by using appropriately sized packaging. The Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations require businesses to ensure that all packaging does not exceed what is needed to make sure that the products are safe, hygienic and acceptable for both the packed product and for the consumer. These Regulations apply to those responsible for the packing or filling of products into packaging and those importing packed or filled packaging into the UK from elsewhere.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs","created_at":"2018-04-20T12:24:24.987Z","updated_at":"2018-04-20T12:24:24.987Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":205332,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/205332.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Declare the 2016 referendum vote null and void due to foreign interference","background":"It is clear now that foreign influence and inaccurate facts were highly influential on the electorate during the Brexit referendum and therefore the result should be declared as null and void.","additional_details":"","state":"open","signature_count":26413,"created_at":"2017-11-16T08:12:42.345Z","updated_at":"2018-04-21T23:05:44.171Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-11-21T16:09:22.698Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-11-16T21:14:04.074Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2018-03-21T17:02:46.303Z","government_response_at":"2018-04-18T17:04:16.088Z","debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"spencer doane","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"The Referendum was one of the biggest democratic exercises in our history.

Through the Mayor’s office for Policing and Crime the Mayor performs the duties of Police and Crime Commissioner for London; the Mayor is also responsible for fire and rescue services in the capital. \r\n\r\nThe Mayor of London is accountable directly to London’s electorate for his decisions. It is London households who pay the additional precept set by the Mayor, which is charged to meet the Mayor’s costs, over and above each London Borough’s council tax bill. It is essential that those who are affected by the mayor’s taxing decisions have a direct, democratic choice on who the Mayor is, and the ability, if they choose, to elect a different one at the next opportunity. The Mayor of London then governs in the awareness that their electoral mandate comes directly from the people the mayor serves.\r\n\r\nA London Mayor whose electoral mandate comes from the whole nation may seek to serve the interests of voters in the UK as a whole, rather than those of Londoners. If elected by the UK voters as a whole, mayor would no longer be representative of the city the mayor is elected to govern. When Government devolves significant powers to an area, as it has with the London Mayor, and with mayors of other city regions such as Greater Manchester and the West Midlands, it has done so on the basis that the mayors are directly accountable through the ballot box to the area they govern and serve.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Housing, Communities and Local Government","created_at":"2018-01-24T14:55:46.232Z","updated_at":"2018-01-24T14:55:46.232Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":203692,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/203692.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Teach black history In History lessons","background":"Introduce black history into primary and secondary schools","additional_details":"Black history is only taught in some schools and only as and when teachers feel it may be necessary.\r\nWe are asking the goverment to look at this closely to make black history become a part of history studies throughout the year.\r\nAlso looking at ways to have black history as part of GCSE options in secondary schools.","state":"open","signature_count":19900,"created_at":"2017-10-25T15:04:37.622Z","updated_at":"2018-04-21T23:35:44.179Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2017-11-01T17:54:31.700Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2017-10-27T14:46:11.351Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2017-11-09T09:58:40.175Z","government_response_at":"2017-11-23T17:48:06.449Z","debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"stephanie pitter","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"The national curriculum gives examples of black history topics, which schools may teach at each key stage.

Enforcement can form part of moving someone away from the streets but it should also come with an offer of meaningful support.  In developing the strategy, the Taskforce and Advisory Panel will consider a range of measures to support rough sleepers off the streets, including enforcement measures where appropriate.\r\n\r\nUnder sections 3 and 4 of the Vagrancy Act 1824, begging and persistent begging in a public place are arrestable offences.  They are also recordable offences which enables the police to identify repeat offenders. Decisions on arrests are an operational matter for the police, in line with their duties to keep the peace, to protect communities, and to prevent the commission of offences, working within the provisions of the legal framework set by Parliament (or, as appropriate, the common law).\r\n\r\nIt is an operational decision for the police following advice from the Crown Prosecution Service, whether or not an offence reaches the threshold required for prosecution under the relevant legislation.\r\n\r\nIf any person whilst begging uses threatening or abusive words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour, within the hearing or sight of a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby then they could be prosecuted for an offence under the Public Order Act 1986 and if convicted are liable to be fined.  There are also a range of offences under the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 which are available if violence is used by a beggar.\r\n\r\nThe Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 introduced Public Spaces Protection Orders (PSPO) which place restrictions or impose conditions on activities that people may carry out in a designated area.  These replaced the use of Anti-social Behaviour Orders.  PSPOs should not be used to target people based solely on the fact that someone is homeless or rough sleeping, as this in itself is unlikely to mean that such behaviour is having an unreasonably detrimental effect on the community’s quality of life which justifies the restrictions imposed.  Councils may receive complaints about homeless people, but they should consider whether the use of a PSPO is the appropriate response.  These Orders should be used only to address any specific behaviour that is causing a detrimental effect on the community’s quality of life which is beyond the control of the person concerned. \r\n \r\nCouncils should therefore consider carefully the nature of any potential PSPO that may impact on homeless people and rough sleepers.  It is recommended that any Order defines precisely the specific activity or behaviour that is having the detrimental impact on the community.  Councils should also consider measures that tackle the root causes of the behaviour, such as the provision of public toilets. \r\n \r\nThe council should also consider consulting with national or local homeless charities when considering restrictions or requirements which may impact on homeless people and rough sleepers.\r\n\r\nHome Office","created_at":"2018-02-01T10:05:25.323Z","updated_at":"2018-02-01T10:05:25.323Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":204631,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/204631.json"},"attributes":{"action":"The Government must publish their consultation on social care by early 2018.","background":"A chronic lack of funding means that over 1 million older and disabled people are going without the care they need, including help to get out of bed, wash and eat - without this basic help they cannot live a decent life.","additional_details":"Pledges to fix the care system have been repeatedly pushed aside by governments for the last 20 years, whilst people go on struggling to find care for their loved ones.

Our vision for care must also incorporate the wider networks of support and services which help older people to live independently, including the crucial role of housing and the interaction with other public services.  It must consider how care is provided at present and challenge the system to embrace new technology, innovation and workforce models which can deliver better quality and value.\r\n\r\nTo deliver a lasting solution, it is right that we take the time needed to debate these complex issues and listen to a range of perspectives to build consensus.  For this reason, over the coming months, we will work with experts, stakeholders, people using care and support services, and carers to shape the long-term reform which is urgently needed.  The Government has already established an Inter-Ministerial Group to oversee development of the Green Paper, and as part of this initial engagement we have asked a number of independent experts in this area to provide their views to the group.  The Government will also engage closely with representatives from local government, the NHS, the voluntary sector and care providers, as well as with people who use care and support and carers, to underpin development of the Green Paper.  And when the Green Paper is published, it will then be subject to a full public consultation, providing a further opportunity for interested parties to give their views.\r\n\r\nWhilst the Green Paper will focus on care for older people, the Government recognises both the challenges faced by people of working age with care needs and the many common questions about the sustainability of the care system.  Many of the discussions on the Green Paper reforms will impact on care and support for adults of all ages.  However, to ensure that issues for working-age adults with care needs are considered in their own right, the Government will take forward a parallel programme of work, led jointly by the Department of Health and the Department for Communities and Local Government, which will focus on this group.  This work will also be overseen by the Inter-Ministerial Group to ensure alignment with the Green Paper.\r\n\r\nThe Green Paper presents a unique opportunity to build consensus around reforms which can last. There is no escaping that building a sustainable care and support system will require choices about what that system should provide and how it is paid for.  But getting this right promises a better system that everyone can have confidence in, where people understand their responsibilities, can prepare for the future, and know that the care they receive will be to a high standard and help them maintain their independence and wellbeing.\r\n\r\nDepartment of Health","created_at":"2017-11-24T14:46:39.794Z","updated_at":"2017-11-24T14:46:39.794Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":209872,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/209872.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make Hedgehogs a Protected Species","background":"We, the undersigned, call on the government to make hedgehogs an officially protected species and to limit activities which may disturb, degrade or destroy their habitats.

The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has set clear requirements on the professions, skills, experience and training of the Healthcare Professionals that our assessment providers can use to carry out PIP and ESA assessments and all are registered with an appropriate professional body such as the General Medical Council (GMC), Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) or the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC). \r\n\r\nHealthcare Professionals do not need to be an expert in a condition to assess the impact of a condition on a claimant’s (i) capability for work or work related activity in ESA, or (ii) daily living activities and mobility in PIP. The assessment is not designed to diagnose or give a clinical prognosis. Instead, the emphasis is on ensuring that the Healthcare Professionals are experts in disability analysis, focusing on the effects of health conditions and impairments on the individual claimant’s daily life. The role differs from the therapeutic role of healthcare professionals in reaching a diagnosis and/or planning treatment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their profession DWP recognises the importance of ensuring individuals also have sufficient experience, skills and training. All PIP and ESA  Healthcare Professionals must complete a comprehensive training programme approved by DWP and pass an assessment of competence before they can carry out assessments. \r\n\r\nThe National Health Service (NHS) is the national healthcare system for the UK, and is not designed to administer welfare benefits. Although doctors are responsible for issuing medical statements to patients, they are not responsible for making the decision on eligibility for benefit. For example, GPs and their representative body, the British Medical Association, have made it clear that they do not want to be guardians of the benefit system. The primary role of the GP or hospital doctor is to diagnose and treat any medical conditions that the patient presents to them and a clinician does not routinely consider the functional restrictions or disabling effects of the medical conditions that they treat. They are unlikely to have received specific training in assessing disabilities in their medical education, and may have difficulty in giving an accurate assessment or forming an opinion in relation to the functional restrictions experienced by their patient. They are also unlikely to have any knowledge of the legislative requirements in relation to benefit entitlement.  \r\n\r\nDecisions on both PIP and ESA are made by DWP Decision Makers based on the advice received from the assessment provider together with the evidence supplied by the claimant in their questionnaire and any additional evidence they submit or which has been requested.\r\n\r\nMany claimants to PIP and ESA present with life-limiting conditions meaning that some may sadly die during the course of claiming or receiving benefit. However, we don’t believe there is any causal link between claiming benefit and death.\r\n\r\nThe Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is an international human rights treaty of the United Nations (UN) intended to protect the rights and dignity of persons with Disabilities. All nations signed up to the convention are subject to a periodic review as part of the standard UN reporting process. We were disappointed that the concluding observations of the UN did not accurately reflect the evidence we gave to the committee.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Work and Pensions ","created_at":"2018-04-16T12:13:29.883Z","updated_at":"2018-04-16T12:13:29.883Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":205852,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/205852.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Strengthen the 2004 Hunting Act","background":"Week in week out hunts up and down the country continue to use loopholes in the Hunting Act to kill wildlife.

A patient with a disability is not discriminated against should they require a transplant, they are assessed in the same way as any other potential recipient.\r\n\r\nAll patients undergo careful assessment before being placed onto the transplant waiting list. This assessment is divided into three main questions. First, whether a patient needs a transplant or whether another more effective treatment is available. Secondly the patient’s fitness is assessed to confirm whether they are well enough to receive a transplant. A transplant operation and the associated treatment that is required to make the transplant work is reasonably risky. Sometimes the patient needs extra procedures or medication before a transplant is even possible. Sadly, some people are just not fit enough to have this life saving or life enhancing operation. Thirdly there is an assessment of whether the patient is going to be able to care for themselves (and the transplant organ) after the transplant. This third stage is treated with particular care as the medical team will need to know whether the patient is able to look after their general health and take all the necessary medication in order to avoid rejection in the new transplant. \r\n\r\nWhen a patient with a learning disability is identified as being suitable for a transplant, the key factors are ensuring their consent can be obtained either directly or through their carer or representative and that they have the correct support during post-operative care. In most circumstances, the recipient’s family or carers will be very keen and supportive in giving all care that is needed after the transplant operation. Alternatively, if the patient does not have a carer, social services can often provide the support a person with a disability might need after undergoing a medical procedure. \r\n\r\nDuring the period after a patient has received a transplant, there will be a number of medications that the patient will need  to take. This includes immunosuppressants – drugs which make it much less likely that the new transplanted organ will be rejected. If a transplant recipient decides to discontinue the required post-operative medication, rejection of the organ is very likely to follow, which is why it is important that a patient receives the support they need.\r\n\r\nThere are a range of duties and supporting tools to ensure health professionals are able to support people with a learning disability. \r\n\r\nAll public bodies, including NHS organisations, must be proactive in eliminating unlawful discrimination and advancing equal opportunities, under the Equality Act. Since 1st August 2016 onwards, all organisations that provide NHS care or adult social care have been legally required to follow the Accessible Information Standard. The Standard aims to make sure that people who have a disability, impairment or sensory loss are provided with information that they can easily read and understand and with support so they can communicate effectively with health and social care services.\r\n\r\nThe Government has mandated Health Education England (HEE) to provide national leadership on education, training and workforce development in the NHS in England.

The Government is committed to creating a safe environment in which cases can be heard and justice can be delivered.\r\n \r\nThe number of rape convictions have risen by nearly 60% in the last decade, but we know more must be done, to ensure consistent just outcomes. Active steps have been taken to ensure that rape cases are dealt with appropriately and sensitively. Crown Prosecutors and judicial office holders must undergo specialist training before they are authorised to take on rape cases. Most professionals involved in rape trials will therefore be well attuned to the challenges surrounding cases including the issues of rape myths. We are also rolling out pre-recorded cross-examination for vulnerable witnesses to ensure that they can give their best evidence.\r\n  \r\nJuries must of course consist of twelve randomly selected individuals. They will therefore bring their own ideas and experiences to their analysis of the facts of the case.

However, there is little empirical evidence, which is needed to discern the impact of rape myths on juries and ensure that appropriate measures are taken.\r\n \r\nEnsuring that the balance is struck between jurors understanding rape myths, without encroaching on the rights to a fair trial of the defendant is not a straightforward task.

The Government recognises that healthy, active peat provides good habitat for grouse as well as numerous environmental benefits and ecosystem services. The Government is working with moor owners and stakeholders to further improve management practices and peat condition, such as through the Blanket Bog Restoration Strategy.\r\n\r\nWith regard to birds of prey, like all wild birds they are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. The current legislation and guidance balances competing social, economic and environmental interests, while protecting the conservation status and welfare of the relevant bird of prey species. Some species of birds of prey need specific protection because their low numbers indicate that their populations are struggling.\r\n\r\nThe Government takes the decline in the hen harrier population in England very seriously and is committed to securing its future. In January 2016 we published the Hen Harrier Action Plan to increase the English hen harrier population. It contains six actions that individually can bring benefits for hen harriers, but when combined underpin each other and have the potential to deliver positive outcomes. \r\n\r\nThe Action Plan was developed with senior representatives from organisations including Natural England, the Moorland Association, the National Gamekeepers’ Organisation, the Game \u0026 Wildlife Conservation Trust, National Parks England and formerly the RSPB. These organisations, led by Natural England, will monitor activities and report annually on progress to the Defra Uplands Stakeholder Forum and the UK Tasking and Co-ordinating group for Wildlife Crime.\r\n\r\nRaptors, like all wild birds, are afforded protection from illegal killing by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. However, the Government is concerned that there are still individuals who continue to commit these crimes. \r\n\r\nAs a result, the Government has identified the illegal persecution of raptors as a wildlife crime priority. Each wildlife crime priority has a delivery group to consider what action should be taken, and develop a plan to prevent crime, gather intelligence on offences and enforce against it. The Raptor Persecution Priority Delivery Group is made up of representatives from Government and non-government organisations working together to help preserve and protect the six UK priority raptor species (goshawk, red kite, golden eagle, hen harrier, peregrine falcon and white tailed eagle). \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the National Wildlife Crime Unit, which is part-funded by Defra, provides valuable intelligence and operational support to police forces in tackling wildlife crimes, including raptor persecution.

The current legislation and guidance balances competing social, economic and environmental interests, while protecting the conservation status and welfare of the relevant bird of prey species. Some species of birds of prey need specific protection because their low numbers indicate that their populations are struggling.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ","created_at":"2018-01-11T14:41:50.019Z","updated_at":"2018-01-11T14:41:50.019Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":204121,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/204121.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Do not extend IR35 legislation to the private sector.","background":"There is evidence that the Chancellor is planning to extend IR35 legislation to the private sector in an attempt to equalise the payments and tax regimes between contractors and permanent employees.

There are many legitimate, commercial reasons for people to do this and for businesses to engage them in this way. The off-payroll working rules, more commonly known as IR35, have been in place since 2000 to ensure that, where individuals would have been employees if they were providing their services directly, they pay broadly the same tax and National Insurance as other employees. It is fair that two individuals doing the same job in the same way pay broadly the same tax and National Insurance, even if one of them structures their work through a company.\r\n\r\nAs highlighted by reports from the Office of Tax Simplification and the House of Lords, it is clear that IR35 is not effective enough. To improve compliance, the Government introduced reforms in the public sector from April 2017. Individuals working through their own company in the public sector are no longer responsible for operating the off-payroll rules. Instead, where an individual’s company is directly engaged by a public sector body, the public sector body is responsible for determining whether or not the rules apply, and deducting any necessary employment taxes on payments to the individual’s company. Where this engagement takes place through an agency, the public sector body is responsible for determining whether or not the rules apply and informing the agency of this decision, in order that any necessary employment taxes can be deducted by the agency.\r\n\r\nThis is not a new tax on the self-employed. IR35 only applies to those who work like employees and would have been employed were they not working through a company. Genuinely self-employed individuals continue to be unaffected, as has been the case for over 15 years.\r\n\r\nThe Government is monitoring the impact of its reform of IR35 in the public sector. Initial evidence suggests that it has been successful in improving compliance. More people working through their own company are paying the right tax. However, the cost of non-compliance in the private sector is still growing and will cost taxpayers £1.2 billion a year by 2022/23. Therefore, a possible next step would be to extend these reforms to the private sector. \r\n\r\nTo take account of the needs of businesses and individuals who would implement any change, the Government will carefully consult on reform in the private sector, drawing on the experience of the public sector reforms, including through external research due to be published in the new year.\r\n\r\nHM Treasury","created_at":"2017-11-30T14:16:56.274Z","updated_at":"2017-11-30T14:16:56.274Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":204079,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/204079.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Ban Isis fighters from returning to the UK","background":"Anybody who has left this country to join ISIS should not be allowed to return.","additional_details":"We the people of the UK have a right to live safely without fear of Isis fighters returning to attack us.

The Government has committed to hold a vote on the final deal in Parliament as soon as possible after the negotiations have concluded. This vote will cover both the Withdrawal Agreement and the terms for our future relationship. If Parliament supports the resolution to proceed with the Withdrawal Agreement and the terms for our future relationship, the Government will bring forward a Withdrawal Agreement \u0026 Implementation Bill to give the Withdrawal Agreement domestic legal effect.\r\n\r\nWhere it is necessary to implement future agreements the Government will introduce further legislation where it is needed, ensuring further opportunities for proper parliamentary scrutiny. \r\n\r\nWith regards to our future security partnership with the EU, in Munich, the Prime Minister set out the UK’s unconditional commitment to European security. It has always been the case that our security at home is best advanced through global cooperation, working with institutions that support that, including the EU. We want to develop a new partnership with the EU that builds on the depth and breadth of our existing security relationship; from foreign and defence policy, to law enforcement and criminal judicial cooperation.\r\n\r\nOur success will also depend on a breadth of partnerships that extend beyond cooperation with the EU. We must develop more bilateral cooperation between European nations, build the ad-hoc groupings that allow us to counter terrorism and hostile state threats, and we must ensure a reformed, modernised NATO remains the cornerstone of our shared security.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlongside this, the UK remains committed to using its assets, capabilities and influence alongside the EU and our European partners. Our cooperation in this regard is not just vital because our people face common threats, but also because we share a deep, historic belief in the same values - the values of peace, democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.\r\n\r\nThe UK therefore seeks to develop a deep and special partnership with the EU that goes beyond existing third country arrangements, and which builds on the breadth and depth of our shared interests and values. This must be a partnership that underpins practical collaboration to tackle real world challenges.\r\n\r\nAs part of this cooperation, where it is in the mutual interest, the UK would be ready to participate in EU missions and operations. However, we would require a level of involvement in the development and planning of such missions and operations, commensurate with the scale of deployment and the operational risk attached. \r\n\r\nIn other areas, a more informal relationship could work for both parties. For instance, we will no longer be party to Common Foreign and Security Policy, and will pursue an independent foreign policy. But we should maintain regular close consultations on foreign and security policy issues, and align where it is in our mutual interest. An informal, political relationship would enable cooperation but retain the autonomy of both the UK and the EU.\r\n\r\nWe intend, therefore, to approach negotiations with flexibility and practical benefit in mind. We are not seeking a one-size-fits-all approach to institutional engagement, which we consider could be counter-productive. \r\n\r\nWe want the EU to succeed in its foreign and security policy goals, which we share, as made clear in the Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015 and the 2016 EU Global Strategy.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Exiting the European Union","created_at":"2018-04-10T16:07:55.949Z","updated_at":"2018-04-10T16:07:55.949Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":216496,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/216496.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Add Multiple Sclerosis to the Medical Exemption list","background":"To obtain a Medical Exemption Certificate and get free NHS prescriptions a condition needs to be on the current Medical Exemption list.

The Government is committed to using robust evidence to guide policy decisions and further measures are not ruled out.\r\n\r\nConsultations with experts from the UK and EU tyre industry revealed that tyre ageing is more complex than a simple relationship with chronological age and is related to wider issues such as tyre use and maintenance. \r\n\r\nIn seeking scientific evidence to inform the policy options, it became clear that there is limited research in this field. Therefore, in January 2018, the Department for Transport initiated a 12-month programme of independent research with the purpose of gaining a better understanding of the ageing process of tyres. This research seeks to quantify the effect of age on a tyre’s integrity, provide guidance on whether an age limit is appropriate and, if so, what that limit should be. The findings of the research will inform decisions and will be published. \r\n\r\nIn advance of the research, the Government worked with the tyre industry, the Traffic Commissioners and the vehicle operating industry to improve tyre management.  In 2014, guidance was issued to all PSV operators and to the members of the trade associations - the Confederation of Passenger Transport and the Road Haulage Association. This guidance explained how to establish the age of a tyre and included a recommendation that any tyre over 10 years of age should only be fitted as part of a twin wheel arrangement on a rear axle. This initial guidance was supplemented by a more comprehensive tyre maintenance guide, produced by the tyre industry with the support of the Senior Traffic Commissioner and the Department for Transport (the Department), aimed at ensuring good tyre maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe Department ensured that a printed copy of this guide was delivered to every PSV operator. This guidance is also available on the British Tyre Manufacturers’ Association website (http://btmauk.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/October-2016-CV-TyreManagement-LINKS-270916.pdf).\r\n\r\nIn parallel, Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) enforcement staff carried out spot checks on older buses and coaches to assess the age of tyres in this segment of the national fleet. These checks were in addition to their normal enforcement programme. A year after the initial guidance was published, a further survey of older buses and coaches indicated a reduction in the average age of tyres fitted in the PSV fleet and demonstrated widespread compliance with the published advice. \r\n\r\nThe combination of guidance and enforcement has been successful to date. Official figures show that in the period between June and September 2017, the DVSA conducted 28,524 roadworthiness inspections on PSVs. Of those, approximately 0.23% failed to meet the minimum requirements for tyres set down in regulation.  Approximately 0.03% of the vehicles had tyres older than 10 years fitted to the front axle and, importantly, only four of these vehicles (approximately 0.014%) had tyres older than 11 years. These figures indicate that the industry is adhering to the guidance that has been issued. DVSA vehicle examiners have been instructed to remain vigilant and to issue official advice notes to reinforce the message on those operators who have not followed best practice.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Department wants to go further in examining this important issue. It will continue to monitor the use of tyres in the PSV fleet and will look carefully at the evidence that emerges from the independent scientific research to determine what further measures are appropriate.\r\n\r\nDepartment for Transport","created_at":"2018-03-01T14:39:43.963Z","updated_at":"2018-03-01T14:39:43.963Z"},"debate":null}},{"type":"petition","id":214119,"links":{"self":"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/214119.json"},"attributes":{"action":"Make Universities UK subject to the Freedom of Information Act.","background":"We ask that the appropriate Government Minister make an order under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 Section 5(1) designating Universities UK as a public authority, so making Universities UK subject to the Freedom of Information Act.","additional_details":"Universities are rightly subject to the Freedom of Information Act.

Other similar sector-wide organisations have been so designated by this method.","state":"open","signature_count":12926,"created_at":"2018-03-02T10:15:21.761Z","updated_at":"2018-04-21T19:09:00.477Z","rejected_at":null,"opened_at":"2018-03-05T22:20:05.528Z","closed_at":null,"moderation_threshold_reached_at":"2018-03-02T16:01:03.872Z","response_threshold_reached_at":"2018-03-10T13:04:15.326Z","government_response_at":"2018-04-16T09:14:49.573Z","debate_threshold_reached_at":null,"scheduled_debate_date":null,"debate_outcome_at":null,"creator_name":"Sean Murphy","rejection":null,"government_response":{"summary":"Universities UK does not meet the criteria for being added to the scope of the Freedom of Information Act as set out in sections 4 and 5 of the legislation, and there are no plans to alter these.
